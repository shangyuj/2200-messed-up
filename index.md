## 9/3 Morphology
### Objectives for this lesson
- Understand that words have an internal structure (studied in the branch of linguistics known as morphology)
- Apply morphological concepts like root and affix in analysis of word structure
- Understand the difference between derivational and inflectional word formation

### Warm-up question
#### What‚Äôs the difference between these?
- word
- morpheme
- syllable

<details>
  <summary>üëÜ Click me for answer</summary>
  word: the	smallest	unit	of	language	that	can	stand	on	its	own   <br>
  morpheme: the smallest meaningful unit in a word   <br>
  syllable: a word or part of a word that contains a single vowel sound   
</details>
  
#### What makes [this poem](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/42916/jabberwocky) English sounding?
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31e66e30-4499-4d8b-af95-fae7c37b29c3)


### Morphological structure in English
We call word parts **morphemes**. Morphemes are the smallest meaningful part of language, but unlike words, they don‚Äôt have to be able to stand on their own.

![364076562-1aa87274-ea3f-4685-b979-bdfe780580c7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5d9f480-7653-43c5-8a70-f08907c9a4c2)

### Bound and Free morphemes
- Many morphemes cannot stand alone as words; they are **bound** to other morphemes.
- **Free** morphemes are able to **stand on their** own as words.
- A free morpheme is a word; a bound morpheme is not.

### Free morphemes
A free morpheme is the smallest meaningful unit in language that can stand alone.  
<pre>
health  
giraffe  
week  
side  
boomerang  
sun  
up  
</pre>

#### Compounds
In English we can combine two free morphemes to create compounds that have a new meaning together.
<pre>
weekend      week + end  
sunlight     sun + light  
playground   play + ground  
upend        up + end  
downside     down + side  
moonlight    moon + light  
</pre>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3ff95b6-2aa7-4c73-bf1b-309369a2afda)  

### Bound morphemes
A compound must have two free morphemes. The following are not compounds because the morphemes are not all free:  
<pre>
nonsense  
unkind   
kindness   
removes  
</pre>  

#### Practice
Think of words with morphemes that fit the following formula: (e.g. free + bound = birds; bound + free = rerun)
1. free + bound
2. bound + free
3. free + bound + bound
4. bound + free + bound
5. free + free
6. bound + free + bound + bound
7. bound + bound
8. bound + bound + bound

### Roots and affixes
- root: the base of a word, the morpheme that gives the word its primary lexical meaning
- affix: a morpheme which can come before (prefix) or after (suffix) a root
  
Example: _unhelpful_  
- _un_: affix	(prefix)
- _help_: root
- _ful_: affix	(suffix)

#### Roots
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/390407e8-0f60-4999-92a2-75e68498cbda)

#### Affixes
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3edfc800-4669-4465-ae13-f5ac3ad11e0f)
  
##### Prefixes vs. Suffixes
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27143718-58d5-4ba0-9266-62daee5d7f04)

#### Practice
- What are the roots of the following words?  
a) domestication  
b) mistrustful  
c) joyfulness  
  
<details>
  <summary>üëÜ Click me for answer</summary>
a) domestic  <br>
b) trust  <br>
c) joy  <br>
</details>

#### Identifying roots
Find the common root for the following sets of words. What does the root mean?  
<pre>
nova             auditor             endure              conceive
renovation       audience            duration            capable
innovate         inaudible           durable             susceptible
novice           auditorium          during              capture
novelist         audio               endurance           intercept
</pre>

<details>
  <summary>üëÜ Click me for answer</summary>
nova: classical Latin nova, feminine singular of novus, meaning new.  <br>
audi: classical Latin audƒ´re, meaning to hear.  <br>
dure: Latin d≈´rus, meaning hard.  <br>
capt: classical Latin capere, meaning to take.
</details>

**Tip:** We as ISU students have access to [Oxford English Dictionary](https://go.openathens.net/redirector/iastate.edu?url=https://www.oed.com), where you can find detailed etymology for words.  
  
### Affix: Derivational vs. Inflectional
What‚Äôs the difference?  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e6914a5-96d4-45e9-91c3-1ef1cab7a598)  
- Derivational morphemes **form new words**.
- Inflectional morphemes do not create new words.

#### Derivational morphemes
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b365293f-c264-44b2-9082-4fdc8ad92805)  
Derivational morphemes **form new words**. They do this by altering either the lexical meaning of a root (e.g., nonsense) or by changing the grammatical category of the word (e.g., kindness).  
##### Some derivational morphemes
1. -able
2. -age
3. -ese
4. -ward(s)
5. -esque
6. -ify
7. -less
8. -ness
9. -wise
##### The problem with derivational morphemes
Derivational morphemes are not systematic; they are arbitrary and there are no rules:

sweet: sweetness  
happy: happiness  
kind: kindness  
**but not**
sunny: sunniness  
difficult: difficultness  
warm: warmness  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2ad7a53-304f-4bbc-8c2c-0cb0efe3fd46)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/117958ff-53a2-45bd-aaaf-7367422e18eb)
  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc98d7ab-e69e-4a72-b168-ce34b5110093)

#### Inflectional morphemes
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/613f4185-efc9-412d-ba23-d58a4145b3dc)
- Inflectional suffixes change words but do not make new words.
- All inflectional morphemes are suffixes.
- There are now only eight inflectional morphemes.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/769c8e24-0c23-4a74-94fb-418defac6182)
  
##### Practice
Identify the inflections in the bolded words.
- Example: He **wishes** he could come.
  - -es is the 3rd person singular _s_
 
The August 2020 derecho windstorm was **bigger** than most people remember. The straight-line wind
**gusts** **measured** up to 110 mph in Iowa. Trees were **broken** off by the wind. Nevertheless, **ISU's**
campus **remains** the **prettiest** campus in the world.

## 8/29 Study of Grammar
### Objectives for this lesson
- Identify how grammar is defined
- Learn key influences on English usage (e.g., prescriptive vs. descriptive grammar, regional and social dialects, language standards)
  
### Before we dive in, some questions to think about...
1. Before this course, how would you define what "grammar" is?
2. Do you know someone who is a strict "grammar police"? Do you agree with them? Why?
3. Can you think of any expressions you use now that a different generation might not understand?
4. Can you think of any expressions that someone from a different geographic area uses but you find awkward?
5. Share a time when you criticized or were criticized because of your language use. What was it that made the language nonstandard ‚Äî was it an error or a dialect difference? Do you feel the correction was appropriate?
6. How should language teachers handle dialect differences in the classroom?  

Pick a few questions to discussion with people around you!  

### In-class readings
- Read ["What is grammar and how is grammar used?"](https://canvas.iastate.edu/courses/113318/modules/items/6622711) (5 min)
- Read ["Varieties of English"](https://canvas.iastate.edu/courses/113318/modules/items/6622759) (5 min)

### Definitions of grammar
- Klammer et al. (2010):
  - ‚Äúthe linguistic system that presumably exists in the mind of a speaker of a language‚Äù
    - Syntax + morphology
  - ‚Äúthe knowledge to which we refer when we say that someone "knows" a language.‚Äù
  - ‚Äúa description of the language system‚Äù
  - ‚Äúan ideal set of rules‚Äù
    - *He always uses good grammar.*
  - a handbook containing the prescriptive rules
    - *Look it up in your grammar.*

### Prescriptive and Descriptive Grammar
- Descriptive rules: ‚Äúhow our grammatical system operates, rules that are the same for all speakers of English (e.g., subjects precede verbs in most sentences).‚Äù
- Prescriptive rules ‚Äúgovern the version of English considered appropriate (e.g., Standard American English)‚Äù

### Evolution of grammar study
- The reason why grammar gets a bad rap
- Two hallmarks:
  - Insisted only certain ‚Äúhigh‚Äù forms of English were worth studying
  - Studied it in an complicated, obscure way, using a system borrowed from Latin  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dead31ed-54cc-4858-bb5d-cc17d4809230)

### Prescriptive grammar
- The view that one variety (or use) of a language has an inherently higher value than others and ought to be the norm for the whole of the speech community (Crystal, 1995)  
- An approach to the study of grammar that stipulates the grammatical forms that speakers should use or ought to use. (Cummings, 2018)
  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a264d3bb-7e3e-42a5-9ee4-7a0ddffdbe43)

### Modern/Descriptive views of grammar
- Objective
- More data-driven
- Studying language as it's actually used	by members of a	speech community in	real world contexts

### Prescriptive vs. Descriptive grammar
What camp do you consider yourself to be in at this point? Why?

### ‚ÄúStandard‚Äù and ‚ÄúNonstandard‚Äù
What is your grammar ‚Äútolerance‚Äù? What about the following sentences that make them incorrect from a prescriptive standpoint? 
1. Edwin keeps insisting that the black hole theory has never been proven.
2. Gavin will graduate from bartending school next week.
3. Your brother does not seem nearly as eager to find a job as I.
4. Joey has finally received the body-building course he sent for.
5. Ellen complained that there is too little variation in the cafeteria menus from week to week.
6. I am going to need a long rest when this semester ends.

### Let's revisit these questions:
1. Before this course, how would you define what "grammar" is?
2. Do you know someone who is a strict "grammar police"? Do you agree with them? Why?
3. Can you think of any expressions you use now that a different generation might not understand?
4. Can you think of any expressions that someone from a different geographic area uses but you find awkward?
5. Share a time when you criticized or were criticized because of your language use. What was it that made the language nonstandard ‚Äî was it an error or a dialect difference? Do you feel the correction was appropriate?
6. How should language teachers handle dialect differences in the classroom?  

### Why do we use language differently?
- Language change
- Dialects
- Language development

### Summary of this lesson
- Key definitions in the study of grammar, such as prescriptive/descriptive approaches, dialects, standard and nonstandard language
- Reasons for variations in grammar
