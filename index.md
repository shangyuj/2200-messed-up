# English 2200

## 8/29
### Objectives for this lesson
- Identify how grammar is defined
- Learn key influences on English usage (e.g., prescriptive vs descriptive grammar, regional and social dialects, language standards)
  
### Before we dive in, some questions to think about...
1. Before this course, how would you define what "grammar" is?
2. Do you know someone who is a strict "grammar police"? Do you agree with them? Why?
3. Can you think of any expressions you use now that a different generation might not understand?
4. Can you think of any expressions that someone from a different geographic area uses but you find awkward?
5. Share a time when you criticized or were criticized because of your language use. What was it that made the language nonstandard â€” was it an error or a dialect difference? Do you feel the correction was appropriate?
6. How should language teachers handle dialect differences in the classroom?  

Pick a few questions to discussion with people around you!
