# English 2200

## 9/3 Morphology
### Objectives for this lesson
- Understand that words have an internal structure (studied in the branch of linguistics known as morphology)
- Apply morphological concepts like root and affix in analysis of word structure
- Understand the difference between derivational and inflectional word formation

### Warm-up question
- What’s the difference between these?
  - word
  - morpheme
  - syllable

  word: the	smallest	unit	of	language	that	can	stand	on	its	own   <br>
  morpheme: the smallest meaningful unit in a word   <br>
  syllable: a word or part of a word that contains a single vowel sound

### Morphological structure in English
![364076562-1aa87274-ea3f-4685-b979-bdfe780580c7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5d9f480-7653-43c5-8a70-f08907c9a4c2)
  
### Roots and affixes
- root: the base of a word, the morpheme that gives the word its primary lexical meaning
- affix: a morpheme which can come before (prefix) or after (suffix) a root
  
Example: _unhelpful_  
- _un_: affix	(prefix)
- _help_: root
- _ful_: affix	(suffix)

#### Affixes

## 8/29 Study of Grammar
### Objectives for this lesson
- Identify how grammar is defined
- Learn key influences on English usage (e.g., prescriptive vs. descriptive grammar, regional and social dialects, language standards)
  
### Before we dive in, some questions to think about...
1. Before this course, how would you define what "grammar" is?
2. Do you know someone who is a strict "grammar police"? Do you agree with them? Why?
3. Can you think of any expressions you use now that a different generation might not understand?
4. Can you think of any expressions that someone from a different geographic area uses but you find awkward?
5. Share a time when you criticized or were criticized because of your language use. What was it that made the language nonstandard — was it an error or a dialect difference? Do you feel the correction was appropriate?
6. How should language teachers handle dialect differences in the classroom?  

Pick a few questions to discussion with people around you!  

### In-class readings
- Read ["What is grammar and how is grammar used?"](https://canvas.iastate.edu/courses/113318/modules/items/6622711) (5 min)
- Read ["Varieties of English"](https://canvas.iastate.edu/courses/113318/modules/items/6622759) (5 min)

### Definitions of grammar
- Klammer et al. (2010):
  - “the linguistic system that presumably exists in the mind of a speaker of a language”
    - Syntax + morphology
  - “the knowledge to which we refer when we say that someone "knows" a language.”
  - “a description of the language system”
  - “an ideal set of rules”
    - *He always uses good grammar.*
  - a handbook containing the prescriptive rules
    - *Look it up in your grammar.*

### Prescriptive and Descriptive Grammar
- Descriptive rules: “how our grammatical system operates, rules that are the same for all speakers of English (e.g., subjects precede verbs in most sentences).”
- Prescriptive rules “govern the version of English considered appropriate (e.g., Standard American English)”

### Evolution of grammar study
- The reason why grammar gets a bad rap
- Two hallmarks:
  - Insisted only certain “high” forms of English were worth studying
  - Studied it in an complicated, obscure way, using a system borrowed from Latin

### Prescriptive grammar
- The view that one variety (or use) of a language has an inherently higher value than others and ought to be the norm for the whole of the speech community (Crystal, 1995)  
- An approach to the study of grammar that stipulates the grammatical forms that speakers should use or ought to use. (Cummings, 2018)

### Modern/Descriptive views of grammar
- Objective
- More data-driven
- Studying language as it's actually used	by members of a	speech community in	real world contexts

### Prescriptive vs. Descriptive grammar
What camp do you consider yourself to be in at this point? Why?

### “Standard” and “Nonstandard”
What is your grammar “tolerance”? What about the following sentences that make them incorrect from a prescriptive standpoint? 
1. Edwin keeps insisting that the black hole theory has never been proven.
2. Gavin will graduate from bartending school next week.
3. Your brother does not seem nearly as eager to find a job as I.
4. Joey has finally received the body-building course he sent for.
5. Ellen complained that there is too little variation in the cafeteria menus from week to week.
6. I am going to need a long rest when this semester ends.

### Let's revisit these questions:
1. Before this course, how would you define what "grammar" is?
2. Do you know someone who is a strict "grammar police"? Do you agree with them? Why?
3. Can you think of any expressions you use now that a different generation might not understand?
4. Can you think of any expressions that someone from a different geographic area uses but you find awkward?
5. Share a time when you criticized or were criticized because of your language use. What was it that made the language nonstandard — was it an error or a dialect difference? Do you feel the correction was appropriate?
6. How should language teachers handle dialect differences in the classroom?  

### Why do we use language differently?
- Language change
- Dialects
- Language development

### Summary of this lesson
- Key definitions in the study of grammar, such as prescriptive/descriptive approaches, dialects, standard and nonstandard language
- Reasons for variations in grammar

### In-class quiz

Any question?

### What's next?
In the next part we take a look at morphology — the structure of words.

### Homework
Give the [Morphology Overview](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n4aM8rXXeFNkqBZZEW2NbPUFgvHUrFvu/view?usp=sharing) a read. You can skip the Knowledge Check questions for now. 

## 8/27 Intro
### Welcome to English 2200!
What is English 2200?  
Why English 2200?  
  
#### A little task
How do we form questions in English?  
How would you make the following statements into questions using tags?  
- Joe ate the pizza, didn't he?
- He didn't have any food, _____?
- Mel and Jerry never study, _____?
- The students have worked hard, _____?
- Mr. Jones won't give us a raise, _____?

What are the steps we did automatically?  

### What will this course help you do?
- Recognize what is grammatical (spot the rules)
- Write grammatically
- Help others to express themselves in the best way possible

### Course objectives
- Understand and be able to accurately use terms and concepts related to morphology and syntax
- Be able to analyze the major grammatical structures of English
- Be able to explain grammar influences and uses
  
By the end of the course, you can do this:
