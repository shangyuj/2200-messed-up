What is a non-finite clause? We will learn it after the Thanksgiving break.
## 11/14 Finite Subordinate Clauses (cont.): Adverbial clauses & relative clauses

### Finite Adverbial Subordinate Clauses

Finite adverbial subordinate clauses always fill an adverbial role in the main clause. They convey a range of adverbial meanings, such as when something happened (time adverbials), where something happened (place adverbials), and how something happened (manner adverbials)—typical meanings associated with adverbials.

#### Examples of Time, Place, and Manner Adverbials:
- **Time:**  
  - *After we explained our situation, he let us in.*  
  - *When they called us to lunch, many people did not go.*
  - *These criteria are met once the prosecution negotiates pleas with defendants.*
  - *I would doze off on the sofa while the kids were awake.*

- **Place:**  
  - *Wherever she went, she saw many fine and beautiful things.*

- **Manner:**  
  - *We will go on, as though it never happened.*  
  - *They just might transform your game like they did for me.*

Finite adverbial clauses also convey other meanings such as reason, purpose, result, concession, and condition.

#### Examples of Other Adverbial Meanings:
- **Reason:** *I had misgivings about that because our equipment was far too inferior.*
- **Purpose:** *Since the program had been a success, the company applied for a full permit.*
- **Result:** *Everyone should see it soon, so that we can really exchange opinions.*

- **Concession:** Despite the main clause's truth, other facts may contradict it.
  - *Although she rarely is the protagonist, her presence is felt and appreciated in books and film.*
  - *This article concentrates on software, even though threats also arise from hardware, insiders, and physical attacks.*

- **Condition/Contingency:** The main clause is true only if specific conditions are met.
  - *If our interpretation is correct, we are led toward a completely different view.*
  - *Most students only take the test one time, unless they didn't pass it.*
  - *Stats and carries don't mean anything to me, as long as we win games.*

### Structure of Finite Adverbial Clauses
Finite adverbial clauses begin with a **subordinator** (also known as an adverbial subordinator), which is followed by a complete finite clause with a subject, verb phrase marked for tense or modality, and any required constituents.

#### Diagram Example:
- *After we explained our situation, he let us in.*
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a43acbc0-daa8-441b-b493-04d2097fe3e1)

### Characteristics of Adverbial Clauses
1. **Nature of the Subordinator:** Some subordinators consist of multiple words (e.g., *as though*, *even though*, *as long as*).
2. **Position of the Clause:** Finite adverbial clauses can occur in **sentence-initial** or **sentence-final** positions.

#### Multi-Word Subordinator Examples:
  - *as though it never happened*
  - *so that we can really exchange opinions*

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80bfb1bc-d622-40f3-aa25-4de2ce761b14)


### Complement vs. Finite Adverbial Clauses
Some finite adverbial clauses look similar to wh-complement clauses and finite clauses with *if/whether*. The difference lies in the syntactic role of the embedded clause:

- **Complement Clauses** (obligatory): Fill required roles (e.g., direct object).
  - *You never know **when trouble will crop up**.*  
  - *The brain monitors told them **when I woke up**.*

- **Finite Adverbial Clauses** (optional): Modify the main clause, providing context without filling a required syntactic slot.
  - *They will know the truth **when they hear it**.*
  - *She had told the tale **when she was 21**.*

### Sentence Diagrams by Type

### Finite Relative Clauses

Throughout this semester, we have seen many prepositional phrases that occur after head nouns, functioning to modify or describe the head noun:

- **Example**: *the boy on the winning soccer team*

Finite relative clauses function similarly to post-modifying prepositional phrases by providing additional information about the noun they follow. Here’s how a prepositional phrase can be rephrased into a relative clause:

- **Example**: *the boy who was on the winning soccer team*

This structural similarity is reflected in tree diagrams where both prepositional phrases and relative clauses act as post-nominal modifiers (PNMs) within a noun phrase (NP). The difference lies in their form:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08d79e16-ad79-42ec-a4f0-8d98558a9d64)


---

### Structure of Relative Clauses

Unlike prepositional phrases, relative clauses are finite clauses, containing a subject, a verb phrase with tense or modality marking, and any other necessary constituents. Each relative clause is introduced by a **relativizer** (a function word like *who*, *which*, or *that*). Relativizers can be **relative pronouns** (which, who, whom, whose, that) or **relative adverbs** (where, when, why).

Example diagram of a relative clause:
- **Example**: *the boy who was on the winning soccer team*

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71eff298-af22-4223-a91a-7c55e8cd40bb)


- **Explanation**:
  - *who* acts as the relativizer, introducing the clause.
  - The relativizer points to a gap, or missing constituent, which it helps to fill. In this example, *who* represents the missing subject of the clause: "the boy *who* Ø was on the winning soccer team."

---

### Recognizing the Gap in Relative Clauses

The relative clause is often missing a constituent, known as the **gap**. This gap can be identified by examining the S node to locate any missing syntactic elements. The **relativizer** fills this gap, making the clause complete. The head noun and the relativizer are co-referential; they refer to the same entity, allowing the head noun to logically fill the missing slot in the relative clause.

---

### Types of Gaps in Relative Clauses

The syntactic role of the gap can vary, and relative clauses can exhibit different types of gaps:

1. **Subject Gap**  
   - *Example*: *I have a few kids who are trying some sewing.*
   - **Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79c1ebe4-3bc6-40fd-9354-a2e781983f3e)


2. **Subject Complement Gap**
   - *Example*: *The commercial society that we have become sometimes bothers me.*
   - **Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68ffaba2-89e8-46f9-9154-f5811c9513cf)


3. **Direct Object Gap**
   - *Example*: *They primarily confirmed information that we had obtained elsewhere.*
   - **Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91508329-dc27-4d64-94e8-06295625d1a1)

4. **Indirect Object Gap**
   - *Example*: *Prosecutors talked to the woman to whom he told all his dirty little secrets.*
   - **Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c834bc3d-383c-4b73-bae3-bdf9e45c96a3)


5. **Object Complement Gap**
   - *Example*: *Tony could never forget the hurtful names that his so-called ‘friends’ had called him in high school.*
   - **Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbbc2ae3-2344-454a-9bd5-d3384ae7032d)


6. **Object of a Preposition Gap**
   - *Example*: *We should reject the modern conveniences that we have become accustomed to.*
   - **Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8a3687f-8ef5-46f4-9afd-43766144dfcc)


7. **Adverbial Gap**
   - *Example*: *The ancient prophecies had foretold a time when destruction by man had left the Earth desolate.*
   - **Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1347680d-65fa-47ef-a95b-ea8a696c18f1)


### Restrictive vs. Non-Restrictive Relative Clauses

- **Restrictive Relative Clauses**: Narrow down the reference of the noun (e.g., *He went looking for the kids who stole his bike.*).
- **Non-Restrictive Relative Clauses**: Provide supplementary information without limiting reference (e.g., *One restriction is the dormant Commerce Clause, which prohibits certain state tax schemes.*).

**Note**: Diagramming does not differentiate between restrictive and non-restrictive meanings as this distinction is primarily semantic.

---

### Omission of the Relativizer (Zero Relativizer)

In some cases, the **relativizer** can be omitted (known as a zero relativizer), represented by the symbol Ø in diagrams. Zero relativizers are not possible with subject gaps.

- **Example**: *They primarily confirmed information Ø we had obtained elsewhere.*
![Screenshot 2024-1250](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12f83b48-f658-47c3-9c37-1fec3d824aa8)


### Placement of Prepositions with Relativizers

When the gap is associated with a preposition, the preposition can remain with the relativizer. For instance:

- **Example**: *the woman to whom he told all his dirty little secrets*
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/028ac4b9-162b-4dd0-a098-8e271207f9aa)


## 11/12 Finite Subordinate Clauses (cont.)

### Finite _Wh_-Complement Clauses

**_Wh_-complement clauses** (or **_wh_-clauses**) are a type of finite complement clause that typically start with a **_wh_-word**. These clauses are sometimes called **interrogative subordinate clauses** because they can express **indirect questions**. They are structurally similar to **_wh_-questions** (like *Who are we going to see?*), but they function differently within sentences.

Like **_that_-complement clauses**, _wh_-clauses can occur as complements controlled by **verbs**, **adjectives**, and **nouns**. 

---

### Example of a Verb-Controlled Wh-Complement Clause

In the sentence below, the embedded wh-clause functions as the **direct object** of the verb (bolded), and the _wh_-clause is underlined.

> *Rachel can’t remember **what they served last year**.*

- **Controlling Word**: The verb *remember*.
- **_Wh_-Complement Clause** (Direct Object): *what they served last year*

**Diagram**:  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27841f83-9fe9-4f04-bb98-40b2c32ae98b)

---

### Structure of _Wh_-Complement Clauses

A _wh_-complement clause is similar to _that_-complement clauses in structure. It begins with a **subordinator**, which is the **_wh_-word** (e.g., *what*, *who*, *where*). This subordinator signals the start of the embedded clause, followed by a complete clause that contains:
- A subject,
- A verb phrase marked for tense or modality,
- Any required constituents.

**Example Structure**:  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a910e90-ed3c-4e0c-a7e5-40e20ec0eaa8)

### Missing Constituent: The Gap

One distinctive feature of _wh_-complement clauses is the **gap**—a missing constituent in the clause, which is represented by the _wh_-word itself. The _wh_-word **fills the gap** by moving to the front of the clause, and this gap represents a missing constituent within the clause.

**Example with Gap Identification**:
> *They served Ø last year.*
> - Here, *something* is missing in the object slot, replaced by the wh-word *what*.

This structure is rephrased as:
> *what they served last year*

In full diagrams for wh-clauses, an arrow shows the movement of the wh-word to the front of the clause, linking it back to the gap.

**Diagram with Movement Arrow**:  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f29f362-ab19-4424-8a18-a106e8d01258)

In abbreviated diagrams, we use an arrow to show this relationship between the _wh_-subordinator and the embedded clause, as seen below:

**Abbreviated Diagram**:  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65e4c3e6-8e5f-42a4-8dd5-33904c523601)


### Positions for the Missing Constituent (Gap)

The _wh_-word can fulfill different syntactic roles in the embedded clause by filling in the gap for various types of missing constituents.

---

### Types of Wh-Complement Clauses Based on Control

Wh-complement clauses can occur in various syntactic positions within the main clause, depending on whether they are controlled by a **verb**, **adjective**, or **noun**.

---

### 1. Verb-Controlled Wh-Complement Clauses

#### Wh-Clause as Subject

A wh-clause can serve as the **subject** of the main clause.

**Example**:
> *What was in his heart doesn’t matter.*

**Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/350925e6-5895-4738-9970-46fc6bb7ad99)


#### Wh-Clause as Subject Complement

A wh-clause can also act as a **subject complement** for a copular verb.

**Example**:
> *That would have been how Grandfather would do it.*

**Diagram**:  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/265a6afc-7162-4f7c-8a23-70d6525e31ac)


#### Wh-Clause as Direct Object (Monotransitive Verb)

A wh-clause can serve as a **direct object** of a monotransitive verb.

**Example**:  
> *They had carefully recorded what they had taken.*

**Diagram**:  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/163dc5dd-3bc0-439f-9de4-c1301c5328aa)


#### Wh-Clause as Direct Object (Ditransitive Verb)

Wh-clauses can serve as the **direct object** of a ditransitive verb as well.

**Example**:  
> *I told them when everyone had to clear out.*

**Diagram**:  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/294f4b31-6720-40f7-a696-8a57f26ecbd3)

**Example**:
> *Everyone had been paid what they deserved.*

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42566ebd-593c-4d61-a751-ffeea586ea54)

---

### 2. Adjective- and Noun-Controlled Wh-Complement Clauses

#### Wh-Clause as Adjective Complement

A wh-complement clause can also function as an **adjective complement**, completing the meaning of an adjective.

**Example**:
> *I wasn’t sure who hung up first.*

**Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ee94a60-cb5b-4e0d-83cf-e98633ed675d)


#### Wh-Clause as Noun Complement

Wh-clauses can also complete the meaning of a **noun**, often describing the content or specifics of the noun.

**Example**:
> *I have no question what his ambitions are.*

**Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c19473d9-b4b3-4446-8078-605eb1612055)

### Exercise
1. She wondered what he meant.
2. Who I like doesn't concern you.
3. I told her what I did.

---

## Finite Complement Clauses with If/Whether:

Embedded finite clauses that begin with "if" and "whether" form a type of interrogative complement clause, also considered a subtype of *wh-* clauses. Unlike *wh-* clauses that correspond to open-ended questions, *if/whether* clauses are typically yes/no questions. Here’s an example where the question can be answered with "yes" or "no":
> **Example**: "I've been wondering whether I should speak up."

The structure of *if/whether* complement clauses is similar to other finite embedded clauses. Here:
- The *if* or *whether* functions as a **subordinator**, introducing a complete clause containing a subject, verb phrase, and any other necessary clause constituents.
- Notably, these subordinators do not represent missing constituents within the clause, so there’s no need to add an arrow pointing to them.

Diagram:
- In a sentence like "I've been wondering whether I should speak up," *whether* is followed by a complete clause, making it syntactically self-sufficient.

**Contexts for Use:**
*If/whether* clauses are more restricted than *wh-* clauses. They typically function as:
1. Subjects
2. Direct Objects
3. Sometimes Adjective Complements

---

## 11/7 Finite Subordinate Clauses

### Review: Diagramming Coordination
1. The manager and the assistant reviewed the report.
2. The weather was cold and windy.
3. They bought new chairs and fixed the old tables.
4. He read the book, but he didn’t understand it.

### Review: Types of Subordination (only clausal level)

A **subordinate clause** (or dependent clause) cannot stand alone as a complete sentence. It depends on a **main (independent) clause** to complete its meaning and fulfill a grammatical role within the sentence. These roles can include acting as subjects, objects, adverbials, or complements.

Subordinate clauses are often introduced by specific **subordinating conjunctions** or **relativizers** (such as *that*, *who*, *if*, *when*, etc.) that help indicate their function.

The main types of subordinate clauses are:

- **_that_-complement clauses**
- **_wh_-complement clauses**
- **_if_/_whether_ complement clauses**
- **finite adverbial clauses**
- **relative clauses**

Now we learn each of these clause types in detail. 

---

### _That_-Complement Clauses

**_That_-complement clauses** (often called **_that_-clauses**) are **finite subordinate clauses** beginning with the word **_that_**. They are controlled by **verbs**, **adjectives**, **adverbs**, and **nouns** in a sentence. 

In this context, **control** means that a specific word (the controlling word) governs or relates directly to the _that_-clause. The _that_-clause is syntactically tied to the meaning of this controlling word and often provides additional information required to complete its meaning. 

- **Controlling Word**: The word whose meaning is ‘complemented’ by the _that_-clause.
- **Examples of Controlling Words**: Verbs like *think*, adjectives like *aware*, or nouns like *idea*.

**Example**:
> *I think **that we should just do away with it altogether.***

- In this example:
  - **Controlling Word**: The verb *think*.
  - **That-Complement Clause**: *that we should just do away with it altogether*, which acts as the **direct object** of the verb, completing its meaning.

### Internal Structure of That-Complement Clauses

Regardless of what controls them, all that-complement clauses share the same internal structure:

1. **Subordinator (_that_)**: Introduces the clause and signals that an embedded clause will follow.
2. **Complete Clause**: Contains its own **subject**, **verb phrase**, and any necessary objects or complements.

**Simplified Example**:
> *I think **that we should just do away with it altogether.***

**Diagram**:  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5be6bb3-bcde-48fe-9158-68b2109e51be)

#### Terminology Note

- **Subordinator vs. Complementizer**: The word **that** is sometimes called a *complementizer*, as it specifically introduces complement clauses. However, we will refer to it with the broader term **subordinator** in our diagrams.

#### Omission of "That"

- In some sentences, particularly those with **verb-controlled** that-clauses, the **that** subordinator can be omitted.
- **Example**: *I think Ø we should just do away with it altogether.*

**Diagram**:  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00d4c792-9987-437b-ae29-e34bd257c7ae)

### Types of That-Complement Clauses Based on Controlling Words

1. **Verb-Controlled _That_-Complement Clauses**
2. **Adjective-Controlled _That_-Complement Clauses**
3. **Adverb-Controlled _That_-Complement Clauses**
4. **Noun-Controlled _That_-Complement Clauses**

---

### 1. Verb-Controlled That-Complement Clauses

When a **verb** controls a that-complement clause, the that-clause fills a syntactic role required by the verb, typically as a **subject**, **direct object**, or **subject complement**.

#### That-Clause as Subject

Although rare, a that-complement clause can function as the **subject** of the sentence.

**Example**:
> *That the technique is in demand is no surprise.*

**Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25d40410-fbb4-4f39-a1df-48b2048acffc)


#### That-Clause as Direct Object (Monotransitive Verb)

A that-complement clause commonly functions as the **direct object** of a verb, providing the content of what the subject thinks, remembers, etc.

**Example**:
> *Tom remembered that the sight of them had made him smile.*

**Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62872858-554f-4ce0-9db3-e4adb7978986)


#### That-Clause as Direct Object (Ditransitive Verb)

In some sentences, the that-complement clause serves as a **direct object** of a ditransitive verb, with an additional **indirect object** present.

**Example**:
> *She told her mother that she worried too much.*

**Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e18255c-a612-4541-b404-1071978b0535)

#### That-Clause as Direct Object (Passive Verb Phrase)

That-complement clauses can also act as the direct object in sentences with passive verb phrases.

**Example**:
> *I had been promised that it would be quiet and peaceful.*

**Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c340df7-f904-4daa-af8e-0cb1d12c8eb3)


#### That-Clause as Subject Complement (Copular Verb)

When a copular verb is used, a that-complement clause can function as a **subject complement**, completing the subject’s meaning.

**Example**:
> *One explanation may be that self-esteem measures are not sufficiently specific.*

**Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6480bdb8-3fe7-471a-af3d-a85f891b2529)


---

### 2. Adjective-Controlled That-Complement Clauses

When controlled by an **adjective**, the that-complement clause completes the adjective’s meaning by explaining or expanding on the subject’s state or feeling.

**Example**:
> *They were happy that I had succeeded.*

**Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/980941b5-f6b5-4518-b164-3fa44fa43b22)

---

### 3. Adverb-Controlled That-Complement Clauses

An adverb-controlled that-complement clause provides additional information related to the intensity or extent of an action.

**Example**:
> *Jenny startled so badly that she screamed.*

**Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2306952-8298-4d44-8031-ffcc9a69c252)

(the _that_-clause completes the meaning of "badly," providing the result from how badly she startled)

---

### 4. Noun-Controlled That-Complement Clauses

With **noun-controlled** that-complement clauses, the clause specifies the content of the abstract noun, often acting as a further definition.

**Example**:
> *The idea that any noise could condemn you to death is a fundamental staple of horror movies.*

**Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf2cdc14-8853-46c1-bcd8-b96224a8d25d)

the _that_-clause completes the meaning of "idea," stating what the idea actually is:  
- the idea = any noise could condemn you to death

### Exercise
1. He thought that they might arrive early.
3. They were told that the meeting was canceled.
5. We were relieved that the test was postponed.
6. The dog barked so loudly that the neighbors complained.
8. The idea that we could visit Japan excited everyone.
12. The assumption that everyone understood the instructions was incorrect.

## 11/5 Coordination & Subordination: Introduction

### Overview of Coordination

**Coordination** is a syntactic structure in which two or more elements are linked by coordinating conjunctions to serve the same grammatical role within a phrase or clause. The linked elements are of equal syntactic status, meaning they share the same role in the sentence's grammatical structure.

### Coordinating Conjunctions
In English, common coordinating conjunctions (also known as coordinators) include:
- **Single-word Coordinators**: `and`, `or`, `but`, `nor`, `yet`
- **Correlative Coordinators**: Pairs such as `either...or`, `neither...nor`, `both...and`, `not only...but also`

> **Example**:
> - **Sentence**: *Colleges and universities are experiencing declines in enrollment.*
> - In this example, *colleges* and *universities* are coordinated using the conjunction **and**, and both serve as the subject of the sentence.

### Diagramming Coordination

In sentence diagrams, coordinated elements are represented together under a single node to show their equal syntactic status. The coordinating conjunction appears between the elements at the same hierarchical level, visually indicating their relationship.

### Example Diagram

Consider the sentence:

> *Colleges and universities are experiencing declines in enrollment.*

- **Breakdown**:
  - The words *colleges* and *universities* are nouns that jointly serve as the subject of the sentence.
  - **Diagram**: Both nouns are connected under one node, with the coordinator **and** linking them.

Here’s how the sentence would look in a syntactic tree diagram:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b67ff4e-a177-46d0-8691-1561ec2aca96)

### Types of Coordination

#### 1. Word-Level Coordination

At the word level, coordination can connect nouns, adjectives, or verbs that share the same syntactic role.

**Examples**:
1. **Coordinated Nouns**: *These works reflect contemporary ideas about race, class, and gender.*
2. **Coordinated Adjectives**: *Business at the shop had been slow but steady.*

Each example illustrates coordination at the word level, using a conjunction to link elements that share the same grammatical role within the sentence.

- **Diagram for Coordinated Nouns (Example 1)**:
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/752bb93e-0fe9-42b6-99c1-6b5dd47555c8)


- **Diagram for Coordinated Adjectives (Example 2)**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56624d59-1826-440e-a9a6-7c8fc1de73b3)


#### 2. Phrase-Level Coordination

Coordination can also occur between entire phrases, such as noun phrases or verb phrases, where both phrases serve the same function in the sentence.

**Examples**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9af996d-d554-4225-819a-a6e8387e4cbb)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad56c5cd-292d-4bfc-8ef8-eccae81fe4f9)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2455a392-361b-4645-9472-262a667588d3)

#### 3. Clause-Level Coordination

Finally, coordination can connect entire clauses, giving each clause equal syntactic weight within the sentence.

**Example**:
- *I just have to say it or I might burst.*

In this sentence, the coordinator **or** links two clauses (*I just have to say it* and *I might burst*), each of which could stand alone as an independent clause.

### Overview of Main Clauses vs. Subordinate Clauses

In English syntax, sentences are often composed of different types of clauses. These clauses can be **main (independent) clauses** or **subordinate (dependent) clauses**. Understanding how these clauses function and interact helps us analyze complex sentences and understand sentence structure.

### Main (Independent) Clauses

A **main clause** is a complete clause that can stand alone as a sentence. It has:
- A subject
- A finite verb phrase (with tense or modality)
- Any required constituents, such as objects or complements
- Optional elements like adverbials

**Example of a Main Clause**:
> *I had promised him the next waltz.*

- **Analysis**: This clause is independent and complete. It has a subject (*I*), a verb phrase (*had promised*), an indirect object (*him*), and a direct object (*the next waltz*).

#### Diagram for Main Clause

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9865b040-ffe6-4d35-81c2-0ab41da3402e)


### Subordinate (Dependent) Clauses

A **subordinate clause** cannot stand alone as a complete sentence. It relies on a main clause and fills a syntactic role within that main clause (e.g., as a subject, object, or adverbial).

A subordinate clause is **embedded** within a main clause, meaning it acts as a constituent of the main clause.

#### Embedded Clause Example

Let’s modify the main clause example above by replacing the direct object noun phrase with an entire clause:

> *I had promised him that the money didn’t mean anything.*

- **Explanation**: Here, the clause *that the money didn’t mean anything* serves as the **direct object** of the main clause *I had promised him X*. This clause is embedded within the main clause and cannot stand alone.

#### Diagram for Sentence with Subordinate Clause as Direct Object

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17abfce3-19a7-4a5b-9b90-cd7dbb96339b)


### Characteristics of Subordinate Clauses

1. **Dependence on the Main Clause**: Subordinate clauses are also called dependent clauses because they cannot stand alone; they require a main clause to form a complete sentence.

2. **Syntactic Role within the Main Clause**: Subordinate clauses fill a syntactic role within the main clause, such as the subject, direct object, or adverbial.

3. **Embedded Structure**: In diagrams, a subordinate clause is often shown as an embedded structure within the main clause.

---

### Types of Subordinate Clauses (Preview)

Subordinate clauses can take various forms depending on their structure and role within the sentence. Here are some key types:
  
1. **Finite Subordinate Clauses**: Contain a subject and verb phrase marked for tense or modality.
2. **Non-Finite Subordinate Clauses**: Often lack an expressed subject and use verb forms that do not indicate tense (e.g., *to eat*, *eating*, *eaten*).

In this module, we will focus on **finite subordinate clauses** and their roles within main clauses, including:
   - **_that_-complement clauses**
   - **_wh_-complement clauses**
   - **_if_/_whether_ complement clauses**
   - **finite adverbial clauses**
   - **relative clauses**

Non-finite clauses will be covered in the next module.

---

### Recognizing Main vs. Subordinate Clauses in Diagramming

In tree diagrams:
- **Main Clause**: Appears as the top-level structure in the diagram.
- **Subordinate Clause**: Appears as an embedded node within the main clause, labeled according to its function (e.g., **fin sub cls:DO** for a finite subordinate clause acting as a direct object).

### Complex Transitive Verbs

**Complex transitive verbs** are verbs that require two additional elements after the verb to complete their meaning. These verbs are unique because, unlike ditransitive verbs, they require a **direct object (DO)** followed by an **object complement (OC)** or an **obligatory adverbial (Advloblig)**. 

Here’s a breakdown of the key features:

1. **Direct Object (DO)**: The first element following the verb, which is the entity affected by the action.
2. **Object Complement (OC)** or **Obligatory Adverbial (Advloblig)**: 
   - The **object complement (OC)** provides extra information about the direct object, describing or renaming it.
   - The **obligatory adverbial (Advloblig)** provides essential circumstantial information such as location or state, completing the meaning of the verb.

#### **Patterns for Complex Transitive Verbs**

1. **Pattern 1: Subj + VCT + DO + OC**
   - The object complement (OC) adds more detail or description to the direct object (DO). It can be an adjective phrase, noun phrase, or clause that provides additional information about the direct object.
   
   **Example Sentence**:
   - *Still, he considered himself lucky.*
     - *Himself* is the **direct object** (the person affected by the verb).
     - *Lucky* is the **object complement**, describing the state of the direct object.
   
   **Diagram**:
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76d285ef-2d8e-41cb-9592-2750ccdb05ed)

   **Another Example**:
   - *They found the boy friendly.*
     - *The boy* is the **direct object**.
     - *Friendly* is the **object complement** describing *the boy*.

   **Diagram**:  
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3ad9728-a67e-48bd-b87c-053eda014855)

  
   The above examples use adjective phrases as object complements. Sometimes, object complements can also be noun phrases:
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57a75bcb-7099-4805-83a1-db492fa7a30d)
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24914254-6aa8-4bb2-9ec9-a3f0b6c81cab)


3. **Pattern 2: Subj + VCT + DO + Advloblig**
   - In this pattern, the verb requires an **obligatory adverbial** instead of an object complement. This adverbial often indicates the location or state of the direct object.

   **Example Sentence**:
   - *The verdict left their hope in pieces.*
     - *Their hope* is the **direct object** (the thing affected by the verb).
     - *In pieces* is the **obligatory adverbial** indicating the resulting state of the direct object.

   **Diagram**:  
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5631f4de-7403-41a6-85a9-97e6e4d18d5a)

   **Another Example**:
   - *Americans’ debts are driving the economy into a danger zone.*
     - *The economy* is the **direct object**.
     - *Into a danger zone* is the **obligatory adverbial** providing necessary detail about the state or location of the direct object.

   **Diagram**:
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7f507b9-5877-4f6b-8018-0f873ffce26b)

### Multi-Word Verbs

**Multi-word verbs** consist of a main verb combined with one or more particles (like prepositions or adverbs) that, together, create a new, often idiomatic, meaning. In these verbs, the combination of words changes the literal meaning, making it necessary to interpret them as a unit.

#### **Recognizing Multi-Word Verbs**
To identify a multi-word verb, consider whether the verb and particle together create a unique meaning that doesn’t match the individual meanings of each word. For instance:
- *He ended up homeless.* Here, *ended up* means *became*, which differs from *end* and *up* used separately.

**Examples of Multi-Word Verbs with Single-Word Paraphrases**:
1. *He **ended up** homeless.* (became)
2. *The business **took off** after that.* (succeeded or grew)
3. *The semi-truck had **shut down** the interstate.* (closed)
4. *The court **looked at** traditional forms of communication.* (considered)

When diagramming, treat these verb and particle/preposition combinations as single units under the **MV** node. 

#### **Diagramming Multi-Word Verbs and Identifying Valency**

Multi-word verbs can have different **valencies** based on the sentence’s structure. Let’s look at how to determine the valency by examining the number and function of constituents after the verb.

1. **Multi-Word Verb with Copular Valency**:
   - When the multi-word verb functions like a **copular verb**, it links the subject to additional descriptive information.
   
   **Example Sentence**:
   - *He ended up homeless.*
     - Here, *ended up* acts as a **copular verb** connecting *He* (subject) with *homeless* (subject complement), describing his state.

   **Diagram**:
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee3219b5-86b2-477b-b60f-8625cdcd005d)


2. **Multi-Word Verb with Intransitive Valency**:
   - When there’s no required element after the multi-word verb, it has an **intransitive** valency.
   
   **Example Sentence**:
   - *After that, the business really took off.*
     - Here, *took off* stands alone with no required direct or indirect object, making it an **intransitive verb**.

   **Diagram**:
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e75a9cd2-f6b5-442b-9e39-f0cf31b2185f)

3. **Multi-Word Verb with Monotransitive Valency**:
   - When the multi-word verb requires a **direct object** to complete the meaning, it has a **monotransitive** valency.
   
   **Example Sentence**:
   - *The semi-truck rollover had shut down the interstate.*
     - Here, *shut down* acts on *the interstate* (direct object), making the verb monotransitive.

   **Diagram**:
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd45155a-4bb5-4147-aebb-b7200d55199e)


4. **Monotransitive Multi-Word Verbs with Particle Movement**:
   - For some monotransitive multi-word verbs, the particle can move after the direct object. In these cases, both forms are correct:
     - *The semi-truck rollover had shut down the interstate.*
     - *The semi-truck rollover had shut the interstate down.*

   - **Diagram**:
     ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fae6661-d4b1-4728-bf49-5fc33ad53b25)  

     - Use **…** in the diagram to show the particle’s movement after the direct object. Place an arrow to indicate the particle’s surface position in the sentence.

### Voice
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0a04656-59d6-4431-856e-f8438a5efdc7)

**Voice** in English describes the relationship between the subject and the action of the verb. There are two primary voices:
1. **Active Voice**: The subject performs the action.
2. **Passive Voice**: The subject receives the action.

---

#### **Understanding Active Voice**

In **active voice**, the sentence follows the typical structure where:
- The **subject** performs the action.
- The **verb** is in a straightforward form.
- Any **object** follows the verb, receiving the action.

**Example of Active Voice**:
- *The operative collected the information from Russian intelligence sources.*
  - Here, *the operative* is the **subject** performing the action on *the information*, which is the **direct object**.

---

#### **Transforming from Active Voice to Passive Voice**

In **passive voice**, the action is emphasized rather than the subject performing it. Follow these steps to transform an active sentence into passive voice:

1. **Move the Direct Object to the Subject Position**:
   - In passive voice, the **direct object** of the active sentence becomes the **grammatical subject**.

2. **Add an Auxiliary Verb**:
   - Insert a form of **BE** (e.g., is, was, were) before the main verb. Match the **tense** of the auxiliary verb to the original main verb.
   - Caveat: Sometimes BE can be replaced by GET.

3. **Change the Main Verb to its Past Participle**:
   - Use the **-ed** or past participle form of the main verb (e.g., collected → is collected).

4. **Add a "By" Phrase for the Original Subject** (optional):
   - Place the original subject in a **by-phrase** in the predicate if you wish to keep it. This is called a **long passive**. Omitting it is called a **short passive**.

**Example Transformation**:
- **Active**: *The operative collects the information.*
- **Long Passive**: *The information is collected by the operative.*
- **Short Passive**: *The information is collected.*

---

#### **Valency and Passive Voice**

Only **transitive verbs** (verbs that require an object) can be in passive voice. To analyze valency, first convert the passive back to active form:
- **Example**:
  - *The information is collected by the operative.*
  - **Active Form**: *The operative collects the information.* This is **monotransitive** (one direct object required).

**Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6785d840-fccf-4848-b08c-d6fb05a29726)


When diagramming passive voice, note both the **grammatical function** (position in the sentence) and the **logical function** (role in the action).

1. **Grammatical Subject**: *The information* serves as the grammatical subject but is logically the **direct object**.
2. **Verb Phrase**: Contains **is** (auxiliary) and **collected** (past participle).
3. **By-Phrase**: *By the operative* is an adverbial prepositional phrases showing the logical subject. *The operative* is the logical subject.

**To confirm a clause is in passive voice:**
- Check if the verb phrase includes BE/GET (auxiliary) + past participle (main verb).
- Determine if an active version exists, where the logical subject performs the action.

---

#### **Passive Voice Patterns with Different Verbs**

1. **Monotransitive Passive**:
   - *The priceless Ming vase was dropped.* (Active: *Someone dropped the priceless Ming vase.*)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21b8e76f-090f-4dfd-94af-eb3af5046eb2)


2. **Ditransitive Passive**:
   - Ditransitive verbs allow for both the direct and indirect objects to become the subject.
   - **Example with direct object as grammatical subject**:
     - *No other power had been given to the delegates.* 
     - (Active: *Someone had given no other power to the delegates.*)
       ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ffbfec02-764b-4362-b148-4a30be96dd69)

   - **Example with indirect object as grammatical subject**:
     - *The subjects were handed a copy of the test.* 
     - (Active: *(someone) handed the subjects a copy of the test.*)
       ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53e480a8-2a83-4080-a973-0a945a4ff057)

3. **Complex Transitive Passive**:
   - Complex transitive verbs in passive voice can have an **object complement** or **obligatory adverbial**.
   - **Example**:
     - *The third style of meditation has been called unfocused.*
     - (Active: *Someone has called the third style of meditation unfocused.*)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b3e82f7-5a96-4357-aaf3-db7d227ad198)


4. **Transitive Multi-Word Verbs in Passive**:
   - Transitive multi-word verbs can also be in passive voice.
   - **Example**:
     - *The errors should be pointed out immediately.*
     - (Active: *Someone should point out the errors immediately.*)

### Intransitive Valency Patterns (IT)
**intransitive → not transitive → no objects**  
- **Intransitive verbs** are verbs that do not require any object to complete their meaning. They need only a subject and a verb to form a grammatically correct clause. In other words, the action of the verb doesn’t transfer to any object.
  
**Example**:  
- *Tim smiled throughout the concert.*
  - Here, the verb *smiled* does not act on any object. The **prepositional phrase** *throughout the concert* provides additional information about when the action happened, but it’s not required to complete the sentence.
  - The sentence still makes sense without the optional adverbial: *Tim smiled.*

**Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8cb9697f-0a7c-4e20-8912-3a57d7556faa)  
  
**Another Example**:  
- *They arrived next week.*  
  - Here, *next week* is an **optional adverbial** indicating time. It’s not essential to the sentence’s meaning, but it provides extra information about when the action happened. The sentence has no object.

**Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47782779-6988-423d-bbf8-810c136e015d)  

In summary, **intransitive verbs**:
- Do not require any object.
- May be accompanied by **optional adverbials** that provide extra information about time, place, or manner, but the sentence can stand alone without them.

---

#### **Monotransitive Valency Patterns (MT)**
**monotransitive → ONE transitive → ONE object**  
- **Monotransitive verbs** are verbs that require one additional element after the verb, specifically a **direct object (DO)**. The **direct object** is the entity affected by the verb’s action.

**Example Sentence**:  
- *The man hit the table with full force.*  
  - The verb *hit* needs a **direct object** to complete the sentence. Without it (*The man hit Ø*), the sentence becomes incomplete.
  - *The table* is the **direct object** because it’s the thing being acted upon (the thing that was hit).
  - *With full force* is an **optional adverbial** describing how the action happened, but it’s not necessary to complete the sentence.

**Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5bfa5e1b-869a-4789-bc2b-896e0e132da0)


- In this sentence, the **direct object** (DO) is essential for the sentence to be complete, but the **prepositional phrase** (PP:Advl) *with full force* is optional, providing extra detail about the manner of the action.

**Another Example**:  
- *The dressmaker cut the expensive fabric.*  
  - The verb *cut* requires a **direct object** (*the expensive fabric*). The sentence would be incomplete without it: *The dressmaker cut Ø*.

**Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/772abcfc-6cdd-437c-9aff-bafba00b44b8)

**You can also put a clause in the direct object slot:**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/215db453-7234-4329-af63-b94458166ad4)

**Summary of Monotransitive Verbs**:
- The verb must be followed by a **direct object**.
- **Optional adverbials** may also be present but aren’t required for grammatical completeness.

---

#### **Ditransitive Valency Patterns (DT)**
**ditransitive → TWO transitive → TWO objects**  
- **Ditransitive verbs** are more complex because they require two objects: a **direct object (DO)** and an **indirect object (IO)**. The **indirect object** is typically the recipient of the **direct object**.

There are two common patterns for ditransitive verbs:

1. **Pattern 1: Subj + VDT + IO + DO**  
   In this pattern, the **indirect object** comes before the **direct object**.
 
   **Example Sentence**:  
   - *John gave me the money.*  
     - *Me* is the **indirect object** (the person receiving the money).
     - *The money* is the **direct object** (the thing being given).

   **Diagram**:
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6cacaee-7edb-425f-b00e-debb0b35abae)

   **Another example**
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3506a2b2-06d2-43f5-b132-c379970369cd)

2. **Pattern 2: Subj + VDT + DO + to/for IO**  
   In this pattern, the **direct object** comes first, followed by a **prepositional phrase** with *to* or *for* indicating the **indirect object**.

   **Example Sentence**:  
   - *The teacher sent the homework to the absent student.*  
     - *The homework* is the **direct object** (the thing being sent).
     - *To the absent student* is the **indirect object** (the recipient of the homework).

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/764b48c5-285b-4659-b048-8d57816977f6)

   **Again, sometimes we can put a clause in the object slots, for example:**

3. **Ditransitive verb with ellipted direct object**  
Occasionally, the direct object of a ditransitive verb is ellipted, or not explicitly stated. However, logically, we know that something has to be serving as the direct object.
- For example: _Her mother had promised her._ 
    - _her_ ≠ direct object (_her_ is not what she promised)
    - _her_ = indirect object (_her_ is who received the promise)
  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18b24eda-65e4-48c5-a94f-243c66c6f866)


**Summary of Ditransitive Verbs**:
- **Pattern 1**: The **indirect object** comes before the **direct object**.
- **Pattern 2**: The **direct object** comes before the **indirect object**, which is indicated by a **prepositional phrase** (with *to* or *for*).

---

### Conclusion
- **Intransitive verbs** don’t need objects, and the sentence can often have optional adverbials.
- **Monotransitive verbs** require a **direct object**, and additional adverbials can provide extra information.
- **Ditransitive verbs** require both a **direct object** and an **indirect object**, with different patterns to indicate the relationship between these objects. Additional adverbials can provide extra information.
- **Copular verbs**, connect the subject to a subject complement or an obligatory adverbial to complete the meaning of the sentence. They can't have objects.

### Practice
1. She baked a cake yesterday.
2. They gave him a birthday present.
3. The meeting was in the conference room.
4. The librarian sent the book to the student.
5. He laughed pretty loud.

## 10/22 Clause Constituents and Verb Valency
**Reading: [Diagramming Supplement Part 3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yGsI3knZI8djQyI2LQ2q3ScyyS24o5am/view?usp=sharing)**

---
  
When we talk about **clauses**, we're referring to groups of words that form complete ideas with a predicate. Every clause contains **constituents** that perform specific functions in the sentence.
  
Here are the key components:
- **Subject**: Who or what the sentence is about (often a noun phrase).
- **Verb (Predicator)**: The action or state in the sentence (with the main verb).
- **Object**: The entity that is affected by the action (**sometimes not needed**).
  
In diagrams, we label both the **form** (what type of phrase it is) and the **function** (what role it plays in the sentence). For example:
- **NP: Subj** (Noun Phrase as Subject)

**Example Sentence**:  
*The news outlet retracted the story about the accident.*
- *the news outlet* is the **subject**.
- *retracted the story about the accident* is the predicative **long verb phrase**.
- *retracted* is the **verb phrase**.
- *the story about the accident* is the **direct object** (what got retracted).

#### **Verb Valency Explained**
The term **valency** refers to how many extra pieces (constituents) a verb needs to form a complete sentence. Verbs can require different numbers of these pieces, depending on their type.

Some examples to show you what this means:
- e.g.: **Intransitive verbs (IT)**: These verbs don’t need anything beyond a subject and a verb phrase. Example: *I slept.*
- e.g.: **Monotransitive verbs (MT)**: These verbs need a subject, a verb phrase, and a **direct object** (DO). Example: *I ate the pizza slice.*
  
##### Full list of Verb Valency

| Valency Type     | Abbreviation | Clause Pattern                                  |
|------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Copular          | cop          | Subj + Vcop + SC / Advloblig                    |
| Intransitive     | IT           | Subj + VIT                                      |
| Monotransitive   | MT           | Subj + VMT + DO                                 |
| Ditransitive     | DT           | Subj + VDT + IO + DO / Subj + VDT + DO + to IO  |
| Complex Transitive| CT          | Subj + VCT + DO + OC / Advloblig                |


---

#### **Grammatical Functions and Valency Patterns**

Let’s break down the different parts of a sentence and how verbs interact with them:

| Function                 | Abbreviation | Description |
|--------------------------|--------------|-------------|
| Subject                  | Subj         | The entity the sentence is about, typically placed before the verb. |
| Subject complement       | SC           | Describes the subject, often an adjective or noun phrase. |
| Direct object            | DO           | The entity affected by the verb. |
| Indirect object          | IO           | The entity receiving the direct object. |
| Object complement        | OC           | Provides information about the direct object. |
| Optional adverbial       | Advl         | Additional information on time, place, manner, etc., not required to form a complete clause. |
| Obligatory adverbial     | Advloblig    | Necessary adverbial information required to complete the clause. |

#### **Optional vs. Obligatory Adverbials**

This distinction is important because adverbials can either be optional or necessary for the sentence to be complete:

- **Optional Adverbials**: These are extra details about the action. If we remove them, the sentence still makes sense.
  - Example: *The news outlet retracted the story by the next day.*
    - *by the next day* is optional—it tells **when** the action happened but is not essential.
  
  **Tree Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c75e6cbd-dd9d-491e-8f4f-9bc92a58043f)


- **Obligatory Adverbials (Advloblig)**: These are necessary for the sentence to make sense. Without them, the sentence would be incomplete.
  - Example: *Paul was in power at that moment.*
    - *in power* is essential here. Without it, *Paul was* sounds incomplete.
  
  **Tree Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8337416a-e219-42b9-92a5-a2d157189b2e)

---

### **Copular Valency Patterns**

**Copular verbs** (also called **linking verbs**) are a special type of verb. Instead of showing an action, they connect the subject to something that gives more information about it. These verbs usually need one of two things to complete the sentence:
1. A **subject complement (SC)**: This describes the subject.
2. An **obligatory adverbial (Advloblig)**: This tells something like where or when the subject is.

#### **Pattern 1: Subj + Vcop + SC**
The **subject complement (SC)** describes the subject, often adding more information or identifying it.

- **Example**: 
  - *Frank is a cardiologist.*
  - *The music sounds fantastic.*

  **Tree Diagram**:  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9f12171-ec47-412c-9727-1855f096ee27)

#### **Pattern 2: Subj + Vcop + Advloblig**
The **obligatory adverbial** is needed to complete the sentence, often describing **where** or **when** something is happening.

- **Example**: 
  - *Paul was in power at that moment.*

  **Tree Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cce81da5-8e4c-4391-ac07-9422e9c7a902)


#### **Subject Complement Test for Copular Verbs**
To see if a verb is copular, try replacing the verb with an equals sign. If the sentence still makes sense, it’s a copular verb:
- *Frank = a cardiologist.*
- *The music = fantastic.*

---

### **Examples of Copular Sentences**:

1. *The final exam proved difficult.*  
   - *Difficult* is describing the subject.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b45901fe-4a4b-44b8-9c9f-df158b360bac)


2. *Annie and Janine look surprised.*  
   - *Surprised* is describing Annie and Janine.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b70cdc7-7376-4234-bc0e-78ae1f09c91a)


3. *Her sincerest wish is that Bill makes a speedy and full recovery.*  
   - The subject complement here is a whole clause.

### Midterm Exam
Midterm will be held at 2:25pm on Thursday. At 2pm I will be here for tutoring.

## 10/10 adjCompl (adjective complement); ObjP (object of a preposition); PNM (post-nominal modifier)

Adjective complement, object of a preposition, and post-nominal modifier are three more concepts you need to understand to be able to complete Major Assignment 1 and Midterm Exam. Subject complements and object complements are also discussed below but they won't be in Major Assignment 1 or Midterm Exam.
  
### **Complements**
A complement is a word or group of words necessary to complete the meaning of a sentence. Without a complement, the sentence is incomplete or lacks the necessary information.
  - Complements differ from modifiers, which are optional and add extra information.

#### **Adjective (adjCompl)**
- **Definition**: An adjective complement is a clause or phrase that follows an adjective and provides information to complete its meaning.
- **Examples**:
  - “She is afraid **to speak in public**.” ('To speak in public' is an adjective complement that completes the meaning of 'afraid.')
  - “They are eager **for the meeting to start**.” ('For the meeting to start' complements the adjective 'eager.')
  
- **Types of Adjective Complements**:
  - **Infinitive Phrases**:
    - E.g., "He is happy **to help**."
  - **Prepositional Phrases**:
    - E.g., "We were delighted **with the results**."
  - **That-clauses**:
    - E.g., "I am certain **that she will arrive on time**."
  
Find the adjective complement in Major Assignment 1.

#### **Subject Complements** (not in Major Assignment 1 or Midterm Exam)
- **Definition**: A subject complement follows a **linking verb** (such as 'to be', 'seem', 'become') and provides more information about the subject of the sentence.
- **Examples**:
  - “The weather is **cold**.” ('Cold' complements the subject 'The weather.')
  - “She became **a teacher**.” ('A teacher' is the subject complement providing information about 'She.')

- **Types**:
  - **Predicate Nominatives**: Rename or identify the subject.
    - E.g., "My best friend is **a doctor**."
  - **Predicate Adjectives**: Describe the subject.
    - E.g., "The sky looks **blue**."

#### **Object Complements**  (not in Major Assignment 1 or Midterm Exam)
- **Definition**: An object complement provides additional information about the **direct object** of a verb. It renames or describes the object.
- **Examples**:
  - “They made him **captain**.” ('Captain' complements the object 'him.')
  - “We found the movie **boring**.” ('Boring' complements the object 'the movie.')

- **Types**:
  - **Nouns**: Serve as object complements to rename or describe the object.
    - E.g., "They called her **a genius**."
  - **Adjectives**: Serve as object complements to describe the object.
    - E.g., "The teacher found the paper **interesting**."

### **Object of a Preposition (ObjP)**
- The object of a preposition (ObjP) is the noun phrase that follows a preposition and completes the prepositional phrase.
  
- **Examples**:
  - “She placed the book **on the table**.” ('the table' is the object of the preposition 'on'.)
  - “We talked **about the project**.” ('the project' is the object of the preposition 'about'.)

### **Post-Nominal Modifier (PNM)**
- A post-nominal modifier (PNM) is a phrase that comes **after** a noun to provide more information about it. PNMs often include prepositional phrases, relative clauses, and appositive noun phrases.
  
- **Examples (Types of PNMs)**:
  - **Prepositional Phrase**: “The book **on the table** is mine.” ('On the table' is a PNM that modifies 'book.')
  - **Relative Clause**: “The student **who studied hard** passed the exam.” ('Who studied hard' is a PNM modifying 'student.')
  - **Appositive Noun Phrase**: “My brother, **a talented musician**, is performing tonight.” ('A talented musician' is a PNM that provides additional information about 'my brother.')

## 10/8 Verb phrases: Tense/Modality, Aspect

### Announcement

- Midterm Exam is next Thursday. It's open-book!

### Long verb phrase (LVP) vs. verb phrase (VP) vs. Main Verb (MV)
The LVP consists of the verb phrase plus all other constituents that are required by the main verb.

When diagramming verb phrases, we mark tense/modality, aspect, voice, and valency. Today we learn tense, modality, and aspect. Assignment 1 and Midterm Exam will not ask you to mark voice or valency. In the following examples, I provided the valency labels for some examples, but other times we will use an empty placeholder (MV: _____________) in the diagram to remind you of where the valency information will go.

### The Verb-Auxiliary-Modal hierarchy
- Verbs
   - Auxiliary verbs
      - Modal verbs

Core modal verbs: _can_, _could_, _may_, _might_, _shall_, _should_, _will_, _would_, _must_  
Semi-modal (aka phrasal modal verbs): _had better_, _have to_, _have got to_, _need to_, _ought to_, _be supposed to_, _be going to_, _used to_

What makes modals different from general auxiliaries?
- grammatical tense: modal verbs have no tense
- semantics: modal verbs express necessity or possibility

### Tense/Modality
There are three possibilities:
- present tense (pres)
- past tense (past)
- modal, no grammatical tense (mod (NT))
  
**Note: We mark tense/modality and aspect on the VP node.**

### Aspect
Perfect, progressive, and perfect progressive aspect
- Aspect marking is created through a combination of particular auxiliary verbs and participle forms of verbs:
   - HAVE + ed-participle → perfect aspect
   - BE + ing-participle → progressive aspect
   - HAVE + been + ing-participle → perfect progressive aspect
   - otherwise: simple aspect (unmarked)
 
  
#### Present tense + perfect aspect

### Negation in the verb phrase
#### Negation with BE as main verb
If BE is the main verb, the negator not is added after BE.  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fea67fa-68c4-4e17-9a3a-31fdb341e598)
#### Negation with auxiliary verbs
If there is an auxiliary verb, the negator not is added after the first auxiliary verb.  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32fbfd86-79cd-4a36-ad61-9ccef184d880)
#### Negation with DO as a dummy auxiliary
If there are no auxiliary verbs and the main verb is not BE, then add a dummy auxiliary DO and place the negator not after the newly added auxiliary verb.

## 9/17: Minor Word Classes & Exam Review
### Objectives for this lesson
- Identify the word classes of determiners, prepositions, and conjunctions
- Understand the distinction between definite and indefinite articles, numerals, possessives, quantity words, and demonstratives
- Differentiate between coordinating, subordinating, and correlative conjunctions
  
### Review: Major/Content/Open vs. Minor/Function/Closed word classes
- Major class words = Content words
  - Noun (_castle_)
  - Verb (_decide_)
  - Adjective (_happy_)
  - Adverb (_beautifully_)
      
- Minor class words = Function words
  - Pronoun (_their_)
  - Determiner (_the_)
  - Auxiliary (_will_)
  - Preposition (_across_)
  - Conjunction (_and_)
  - Particle (break _up_)

### Determiners
- Signalers of nouns
- Including:
  - Articles: (_the_ = definite, _a_/_an_ = indefinite)
  - Numerals (_one_, _twelve_, _first_, _third_, etc.)
  - Quantities (_more_, _all_, _another_, _any_, _no_, etc.)
  - Possessives (_his_, _my_, etc.)
  - Demonstratives (_this_, _that_, _these_, _those_)
 - Every determiner has to be followed by a noun phrase.

### Exercise: Determiners
Identify all the determiners in each sentence, along with their type.
1. Our teacher has had enough of this nonsense!
2. The news has caused some drama.
3. Every time a bell rings, an angel gets its wings.
4. I haven’t responded to any message; no apology is necessary.

### Prepositions
- “Pre-position” (before a nominal)
- Including
  - Simple Prepositions (_against_ the wall, _out_ the door, _with_ my best friend)
  - Complex (_according to_ the textbook, _along with_ empirical evidence, _in back of_ the building)

### Exercise: Prepositions
Identify the prepositions in the following sentences:
1. I	have	been	impressed	with	his	style	since	I	met	him.
2. According	to	some	reports,	millennials aren’t	saving	enough	for	retirement.

4. Some	don’t	want	to	eat	carbs	after	8pm.
5. They	are	working	toward	a	solution	to	the	problem	of	icy	campus	sidewalks.

### Particles (vs. preposition)

#### Negative particle
- I am going to the store.
- I am __not__ going to the store.

### Exercise: Are they particles?
1.	I	woke	_up_ early.
2.	She	climbed	_up_ the	stairs.

### Conjunctions (Coordinating, Subordinating, Correlative)
Conjunctions connect words, phrases and clauses inside a sentence. They also connect sentences.

#### Coordinating conjunctions 
- “co”
- a conjunction placed between words, phrases, clauses, or sentences of equal rank
  
**Exercise:** Identify the prepositions and their functions (what do they connect?)
  
- Riley and Tim worked out on Saturday.
- I'll meet you at the ticket window or in the grandstand.
- The dessert was simple yet elegant.
- Kris packed the car and drove away from the familiar house on Maxwell Avenue.
- I disapproved of his betting on the horses, and I told him so. He claims to have won fifty dollars, but I suspect he's exaggerating.

#### Correlative conjunctions
- conjunctions meant to be used in pairs; they correlate in order to make connections and provide equal importance to the points.
  - either ... or ...
  - neither ... nor ...
  - not only ... but also ...
  - both ... and ...

### A debate: Are possessive determiners possessive pronouns?
What do you think?
### Verbs, Auxiliaries, Adjectives, Adverbs
#### Objectives for this lesson
- Use morphological and syntactic features to identify the word classes of verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.
- Distinguish between auxiliaries and main verbs.
  
### Verbs
- Semantic definition
<details>
  <summary>👆 Click me</summary>
  Defined by meaning as a word that expresses an action, being, or state of being
</details>
  
- Morphological definition
<details>
  <summary>👆 Click me</summary>
Defined by the morphological changes applicable to verbs: can	be	used	in	both	present	and	past	tenses; has	both	an	–s and	–ing form  <br>
- Example:  <br>
---    Base form: talk <br>
---    Present tense (third person singular): talks <br>
---    Past tense: talked <br>
---    Past participle: talked <br>
---    -ing form: talking
</details>

- Many of our most common verbs are irregular!

### Auxiliaries
- Minor (or “function”) class of words
- Signalers of verbs (“helping verbs”)

#### Task: Add one, two, three, four auxiliaries to this sentence: _He goes._

#### Function of auxiliaries
- Determining tense, aspect, and voice
- Adding information about likelihood, ability, obligation, etc.
- Structuring questions and negatives

### Exercise: Identify Auxiliaries and Main Verbs
1. Mary had been having so much fun.
2. She should have called her mom.
3. She will be grounded.
4. Now, she has to stay home all weekend.
5. Mary is frustrating her parents.
6. Curfews can be frustrating.
    
### Adjectives
- Semantic definition: “Describing words”
- Morphological definition:
<details>
  <summary>👆 Click me</summary>
Defined by the morphological features applicable to adjectives: have an adjective-making morpheme; takes comparative and superlative morphemes <br>
</details>

- What are some adjective derivational suffixes?
- What are some adjective inflectional suffixes?
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d367fced-07c4-4e7f-a38a-f0a1390385ec)
  
#### Comparative (_-er_ or _more_)
#### Superlative (_-est_ or _most_)
  
### Adverbs
- Semantic definition:
     
<details>
  <summary>👆 Click me</summary>
words that usually modify (limit or restrict the meaning of) verbs <br>
</details>
       
- Morphological definition:
<details>
  <summary>👆 Click me</summary>
Defined by the morphological features applicable to adverbs: have an adverb-making morpheme; takes comparative and superlative morphemes <br>
</details>
      
They are almost the same as adjectives morphologically. How do we further tell them apart?  
  
- Syntactic feature:
<details>
  <summary>👆 Click me</summary>
Adjectives proceed or follow nouns; adverbs can be (almost) anywhere in the sentence. <br>
</details>
       
#### Different roles for adjectives  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc45e9f1-0428-4ced-952e-7006defb67b5)

- Very frequent adverbs are usually grouped according to the extra information they add to verbs:
  - Time: now, today, nowadays, yesterday
  - Duration: already, always, still, yet
  - Frequency: often, seldom, never, sometimes, always
  - Location: there, here, everywhere, somewhere, elsewhere, upstairs, abroad, outside, nearby
  - Direction: away, thence
  - Concession: still, yet
  - Sequence: afterward, next, then
  
Note: Some words look like adverbs but are not:
  - He ran _towards_ us.

### Objectives for this lesson
- Understand what word class is
- Use morphological and syntactic features to identify the word classes of nouns and pronouns
- Understand the distinction between common and proper nouns, count and non-count nouns, abstract and concrete nouns
- Distinguish sub-classes of pronouns

### Identifying word class
Word class = Part of Speech (POS)
- Traditional means of teaching word class: using semantic features
  - Noun = person, place, or thing
  - Verb = action word
- We will use morphological and syntactic features to identify word classes
  - The builder’s _plan_ was to lay the foundations in a fortnight.
  - They _plan_ to visit Paris next spring.
 
### “Major” and ”Minor” word classes
- Major class words: Content words
  - Noun (_castle_)
  - Verb (_decide_)
  - Adjective (_happy_)
  - Adverb (_beautifully_)

- Minor class words: Function words
  - Pronoun (_their_)
  - Determiner (_the_)
  - Auxiliary (_will_)
  - Preposition (_across_)
  - Conjunction (_and_)
  - Particle (break _up_)

### Nouns: What do we already know?
- A person, place, thing, idea, event, etc.

**But we can	also	identify	content	words	by	 their	forms	(morphology)	and	where	 they	are	in	the	phrase	or	sentence	 structure	(syntax).**
  
### ID tests of “noun-ness”
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60fcd955-bcd4-481b-a0dd-9b348711ca5c)

Basically...  
- A noun is a word that can be made plural and/or possessive; it is signaled by determiners

### Common/Proper nouns
- Common nouns are general names.
- Proper nouns are specific people, places, or things.
- Proper nouns are capitalized.
  - The **singer** was excited to take the stage.
  - **Taylor Swift** released her new album today.

### Concrete/Abstract nouns
- Concrete: tangible (people, objects, events)
- Abstract: intangible (ideas, values, emotions)

### Collective and non-count nouns
- Collective nouns
  - Can be followed by singular or plural verb form depending on meaning
    - The **team** is here on vacation.
    - The **team** have chosen different restaurants.
- Non-count nouns
  - Do not take a/an
    - The car needed **oil**.
  - Some can be both
    - Example: water, experience

### Pronouns
Pronouns help us avoid repetition!
- Michael bought the cheesecake for Michael, and Michael ate it all.
- Michael bought the cheesecake for himself, and he ate it all.

### What are pronouns
- They stand in for
  - Nouns
  - Noun phrases
  - Nominals
- A pronoun’s **antecedent** is the name for what the pronoun stands in for.

### Pronoun subclasses
#### Personal pronouns
  - Subject and Object forms
  
#### Possessive pronouns
  - Take the place of a noun and show possession.
    - I want *yours*.
    - They left *theirs* at home.

"My car is expensive." Is "my" a possessive pronoun?  
  
#### Demonstrative Pronouns
- Convey information about the position of something.
  - _this_/_that_/_these_/_those_
    - The girl wants **this**.
    - **That** is unbelievable.
  
"That car is expensive." Is "that" a demonstrative pronoun?

#### Reflexive Pronouns
Formed by added _–self_ or _–selves_ to the personal pronouns
- Must have their antecedent in the same clause.

#### Emphatic Reflexive Pronouns
- Also known as intensive pronoun.
- Serve as appositive to emphasize a noun, but movable
  - I *myself* checked the locks before leaving the house.
  - The oncologist *himself* confirmed the patient’s diagnosis.

#### Reciprocal pronouns
**Each other** and **one another**
- Used as objects to refer to previously named nouns
  - The children borrow from each other.
  - Juan and Claudia help each other. 
  - The sisters never wrote to one another.

#### Indefinite pronouns
There are a lot of them!
- Express quantities, definiteness
- Often unidentifiable antecedent  
  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79dfa079-e657-40cf-911b-80731babf5a0)  
  
#### Interrogative Pronouns
- Used to ask questions
   Includes some Wh- words (_who_/_whose_/_whom_/_which_)

#### Relative Pronouns
_who_, _whom_, _whose_, _which_, _that_
- Occur in relative clauses (clauses that modify their antecedents)

## 9/3 Morphology
### Objectives for this lesson
- Understand that words have an internal structure (studied in the branch of linguistics known as morphology)
- Apply morphological concepts like root and affix in analysis of word structure
- Understand the difference between derivational and inflectional word formation
### Warm-up question
#### What’s the difference between these?
- word
- morpheme
- syllable

<details>
  <summary>👆 Click me for answer</summary>
  word: the	smallest	unit	of	language	that	can	stand	on	its	own   <br>
  morpheme: the smallest meaningful unit in a word   <br>
  syllable: a word or part of a word that contains a single vowel sound   
</details>
  
#### What makes [this poem](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/42916/jabberwocky) English sounding?
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31e66e30-4499-4d8b-af95-fae7c37b29c3)


### Morphological structure in English
We call word parts **morphemes**. Morphemes are the smallest meaningful part of language, but unlike words, they don’t have to be able to stand on their own.

![364076562-1aa87274-ea3f-4685-b979-bdfe780580c7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5d9f480-7653-43c5-8a70-f08907c9a4c2)

### Bound and Free morphemes
- Many morphemes cannot stand alone as words; they are **bound** to other morphemes.
- **Free** morphemes are able to **stand on their** own as words.
- A free morpheme is a word; a bound morpheme is not.

### Free morphemes
A free morpheme is the smallest meaningful unit in language that can stand alone.  
<pre>
health  
giraffe  
week  
side  
boomerang  
sun  
up  
</pre>

#### Compounds
In English we can combine two free morphemes to create compounds that have a new meaning together.
<pre>
weekend      week + end  
sunlight     sun + light  
playground   play + ground  
upend        up + end  
downside     down + side  
moonlight    moon + light  
</pre>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3ff95b6-2aa7-4c73-bf1b-309369a2afda)  

### Bound morphemes
A compound must have two free morphemes. The following are not compounds because the morphemes are not all free:  
<pre>
nonsense  
unkind   
kindness   
removes  
</pre>  

#### Practice
Think of words with morphemes that fit the following formula: (e.g. free + bound = birds; bound + free = rerun)
1. free + bound
2. bound + free
3. free + bound + bound
4. bound + free + bound
5. free + free
6. bound + free + bound + bound
7. bound + bound
8. bound + bound + bound

### Roots and affixes
- root: the base of a word, the morpheme that gives the word its primary lexical meaning
- affix: a morpheme which can come before (prefix) or after (suffix) a root
  
Example: _unhelpful_  
- _un_: affix	(prefix)
- _help_: root
- _ful_: affix	(suffix)

#### Roots
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/390407e8-0f60-4999-92a2-75e68498cbda)

#### Affixes
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3edfc800-4669-4465-ae13-f5ac3ad11e0f)
  
##### Prefixes vs. Suffixes
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27143718-58d5-4ba0-9266-62daee5d7f04)

#### Practice
- What are the roots of the following words?  
a) domestication  
b) mistrustful  
c) joyfulness  
  
<details>
  <summary>👆 Click me for answer</summary>
a) domestic  <br>
b) trust  <br>
c) joy  <br>
</details>

#### Identifying roots
Find the common root for the following sets of words. What does the root mean?  
<pre>
nova             auditor             endure              conceive
renovation       audience            duration            capable
innovate         inaudible           durable             susceptible
novice           auditorium          during              capture
novelist         audio               endurance           intercept
</pre>

<details>
  <summary>👆 Click me for answer</summary>
nova: classical Latin nova, feminine singular of novus, meaning new.  <br>
audi: classical Latin audīre, meaning to hear.  <br>
dure: Latin dūrus, meaning hard.  <br>
capt: classical Latin capere, meaning to take.
</details>

**Tip:** We as ISU students have access to [Oxford English Dictionary](https://go.openathens.net/redirector/iastate.edu?url=https://www.oed.com), where you can find detailed etymology for words.  
  
### Affix: Derivational vs. Inflectional
What’s the difference?  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e6914a5-96d4-45e9-91c3-1ef1cab7a598)  
- Derivational morphemes **form new words**.
- Inflectional morphemes do not create new words.

#### Derivational morphemes
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b365293f-c264-44b2-9082-4fdc8ad92805)  
Derivational morphemes **form new words**. They do this by altering either the lexical meaning of a root (e.g., nonsense) or by changing the grammatical category of the word (e.g., kindness).  
##### Some derivational morphemes
1. -able
2. -age
3. -ese
4. -ward(s)
5. -esque
6. -ify
7. -less
8. -ness
9. -wise
##### The problem with derivational morphemes
Derivational morphemes are not systematic; they are arbitrary and there are no rules:

sweet: sweetness  
happy: happiness  
kind: kindness  
**but not**
sunny: sunniness  
difficult: difficultness  
warm: warmness  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2ad7a53-304f-4bbc-8c2c-0cb0efe3fd46)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/117958ff-53a2-45bd-aaaf-7367422e18eb)
  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc98d7ab-e69e-4a72-b168-ce34b5110093)

#### Inflectional morphemes
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/613f4185-efc9-412d-ba23-d58a4145b3dc)
- Inflectional suffixes change words but do not make new words.
- All inflectional morphemes are suffixes.
- There are now only eight inflectional morphemes.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/769c8e24-0c23-4a74-94fb-418defac6182)
  
##### Practice
Identify the inflections in the bolded words.
- Example: He **wishes** he could come.
  - -es is the 3rd person singular _s_
 
The August 2020 derecho windstorm was **bigger** than most people remember. The straight-line wind
**gusts** **measured** up to 110 mph in Iowa. Trees were **broken** off by the wind. Nevertheless, **ISU's**
campus **remains** the **prettiest** campus in the world.

## 8/29 Study of Grammar
### Objectives for this lesson
- Identify how grammar is defined
- Learn key influences on English usage (e.g., prescriptive vs. descriptive grammar, regional and social dialects, language standards)
  
### Before we dive in, some questions to think about...
1. Before this course, how would you define what "grammar" is?
2. Do you know someone who is a strict "grammar police"? Do you agree with them? Why?
3. Can you think of any expressions you use now that a different generation might not understand?
4. Can you think of any expressions that someone from a different geographic area uses but you find awkward?
5. Share a time when you criticized or were criticized because of your language use. What was it that made the language nonstandard — was it an error or a dialect difference? Do you feel the correction was appropriate?
6. How should language teachers handle dialect differences in the classroom?  

Pick a few questions to discussion with people around you!  

### In-class readings
- Read ["What is grammar and how is grammar used?"](https://canvas.iastate.edu/courses/113318/modules/items/6622711) (5 min)
- Read ["Varieties of English"](https://canvas.iastate.edu/courses/113318/modules/items/6622759) (5 min)

### Definitions of grammar
- Klammer et al. (2010):
  - “the linguistic system that presumably exists in the mind of a speaker of a language”
    - Syntax + morphology
  - “the knowledge to which we refer when we say that someone "knows" a language.”
  - “a description of the language system”
  - “an ideal set of rules”
    - *He always uses good grammar.*
  - a handbook containing the prescriptive rules
    - *Look it up in your grammar.*

### Prescriptive and Descriptive Grammar
- Descriptive rules: “how our grammatical system operates, rules that are the same for all speakers of English (e.g., subjects precede verbs in most sentences).”
- Prescriptive rules “govern the version of English considered appropriate (e.g., Standard American English)”

### Evolution of grammar study
- The reason why grammar gets a bad rap
- Two hallmarks:
  - Insisted only certain “high” forms of English were worth studying
  - Studied it in an complicated, obscure way, using a system borrowed from Latin  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dead31ed-54cc-4858-bb5d-cc17d4809230)

### Prescriptive grammar
- The view that one variety (or use) of a language has an inherently higher value than others and ought to be the norm for the whole of the speech community (Crystal, 1995)  
- An approach to the study of grammar that stipulates the grammatical forms that speakers should use or ought to use. (Cummings, 2018)
  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a264d3bb-7e3e-42a5-9ee4-7a0ddffdbe43)

### Modern/Descriptive views of grammar
- Objective
- More data-driven
- Studying language as it's actually used	by members of a	speech community in	real world contexts

### Prescriptive vs. Descriptive grammar
What camp do you consider yourself to be in at this point? Why?

### “Standard” and “Nonstandard”
What is your grammar “tolerance”? What about the following sentences that make them incorrect from a prescriptive standpoint? 
1. Edwin keeps insisting that the black hole theory has never been proven.
2. Gavin will graduate from bartending school next week.
3. Your brother does not seem nearly as eager to find a job as I.
4. Joey has finally received the body-building course he sent for.
5. Ellen complained that there is too little variation in the cafeteria menus from week to week.
6. I am going to need a long rest when this semester ends.

### Let's revisit these questions:
1. Before this course, how would you define what "grammar" is?
2. Do you know someone who is a strict "grammar police"? Do you agree with them? Why?
3. Can you think of any expressions you use now that a different generation might not understand?
4. Can you think of any expressions that someone from a different geographic area uses but you find awkward?
5. Share a time when you criticized or were criticized because of your language use. What was it that made the language nonstandard — was it an error or a dialect difference? Do you feel the correction was appropriate?
6. How should language teachers handle dialect differences in the classroom?  

### Why do we use language differently?
- Language change
- Dialects
- Language development

### Summary of this lesson
- Key definitions in the study of grammar, such as prescriptive/descriptive approaches, dialects, standard and nonstandard language
- Reasons for variations in grammar
