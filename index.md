## 9/17: Minor Word Classes & Exam Review
### Objectives for this lesson
- Identify the word classes of determiners, prepositions, and conjunctions
- Understand the distinction between definite and indefinite articles, numerals, possessives, quantity words, and demonstratives
- Differentiate between coordinating, subordinating, and correlative conjunctions
### Review: Major/Content/Open vs. Minor/Function/Closed word classes
- Major class words = Content words
  - Noun (_castle_)
  - Verb (_decide_)
  - Adjective (_happy_)
  - Adverb (_beautifully_)
      
- Minor class words = Function words
  - Pronoun (_their_)
  - Determiner (_the_)
  - Auxiliary (_will_)
  - Preposition (_across_)
  - Conjunction (_and_)
  - Particle (break _up_)

### Determiners
- Signalers of nouns
- Including:
  - Articles: (_the_ = definite, _a_/_an_ = indefinite)
  - Numerals (_one_, _twelve_, _first_, _third_, etc.)
  - Quantities (_more_, _all_, _another_, _any_, _no_, etc.)
  - Possessives (_his_, _my_, etc.)
  - Demonstratives (_this_, _that_, _these_, _those_)
 - Every determiner has to be followed by a noun phrase.

### Exercise: Determiners
Identify all the determiners in each sentence, along with their type.
1. Our teacher has had enough of this nonsense!
2. The news has caused some drama.
3. Every time a bell rings, an angel gets its wings.
4. I haven‚Äôt responded to any message; no apology is necessary.

### Prepositions
- ‚ÄúPre-position‚Äù (before a nominal)
- Including
  - Simple Prepositions (_against_ the wall, _out_ the door, _with_ my best friend)
  - Complex (_according to_ the textbook, _along with_ empirical evidence, _in back of_ the building)

### Exercise: Prepositions
Identify the prepositions in the following sentences:
1. I	have	been	impressed	with	his	style	since	I	met	him.
2. According	to	some	reports,	millennials aren‚Äôt	saving	enough	for	retirement.
3. I	haven‚Äôt	played	tennis	in	ten	years,	thanks	to	a	shoulder	injury.
4. Some	don‚Äôt	want	to	eat	carbs	after	8pm.
5. They	are	working	toward	a	solution	to	the	problem	of	icy	campus	sidewalks.

### Particles (vs. preposition)
- Particles are _part_ of a multi-word verb
- Usually changes the meaning of the verb (_throw_ vs. _throw up_).

#### Negative particle
- I am going to the store.
- I am __not__ going to the store.

### Exercise: Are they particles?
1.	I	woke	_up_ early.
2.	She	climbed	_up_ the	stairs.
3.	Throw	your	hands	_up_!
  
<details>
  <summary>üëÜ Click me</summary>
1. particle; 2. preposition; 3. adverb
</details>

### Conjunctions (Coordinating, Subordinating, Correlative)
Conjunctions connect words, phrases and clauses inside a sentence. They also connect sentences.

#### Coordinating conjunctions 
- ‚Äúco‚Äù
- a conjunction placed between words, phrases, clauses, or sentences of equal rank
  
**Exercise:** Identify the prepositions and their functions (what do they connect?)
  
- Riley and Tim worked out on Saturday.
- I'll meet you at the ticket window or in the grandstand.
- The dessert was simple yet elegant.
- Kris packed the car and drove away from the familiar house on Maxwell Avenue.
- I disapproved of his betting on the horses, and I told him so. He claims to have won fifty dollars, but I suspect he's exaggerating.

#### Correlative conjunctions
- conjunctions meant to be used in pairs; they correlate in order to make connections and provide equal importance to the points.
  - either ... or ...
  - neither ... nor ...
  - not only ... but also ...
  - both ... and ...

#### Subordinating conjunctions
- sub- = under, subsidiary
- connects or shows a relationship between ‚Äúunequal‚Äù ideas
- main clause + dependent/subordinate clause
  
Time: when, whenever, after, as, before, once, since, till, until, now that, while, as long as, as soon as  
**Concession**: though, although, even though, if, while  
**Contingency**: if, once  
**Condition**: if, in case, as long as, unless, provided that  
**Reason**: because, since, as long as  
**Result**: so that  
**Comparison**: as, just as, as if  
**Contrast**: while, whereas  

### Exercise: Prepositions or Subordinating Conjunctions?
1. __Before__ the show, seniors and students line up outside the box office.
2. __Since__ some orchestra seats remain unsold at most performances, the opera company sells a small number of them to seniors and students for a low price.
3. Rush rickets have been offered for sale __since__ the beginning of the year, but not everyone knows about them.
4. Ticket sellers often tell older and younger people about the rush __before__ they sell them tickets at full price.
5. Rush tickets go on sale 90 minutes __before__ the performance, and sales continue __until__ all the rush tickets have been sold.
6. Any student or senior who arrives __after__ that has to pay full price.
7. __After__ they buy their tickets, students and seniors have along wait __until__ curtain time.

What do you think?
### Verbs, Auxiliaries, Adjectives, Adverbs
#### Objectives for this lesson
- Use morphological and syntactic features to identify the word classes of verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.
- Distinguish between auxiliaries and main verbs.
  
### Verbs
- Semantic definition
<details>
  <summary>üëÜ Click me</summary>
  Defined by meaning as a word that expresses an action, being, or state of being
</details>
  
- Morphological definition
<details>
  <summary>üëÜ Click me</summary>
Defined by the morphological changes applicable to verbs: can	be	used	in	both	present	and	past	tenses; has	both	an	‚Äìs and	‚Äìing form  <br>
- Example:  <br>
---    Base form: talk <br>
---    Present tense (third person singular): talks <br>
---    Past tense: talked <br>
---    Past participle: talked <br>
---    -ing form: talking
</details>

- Many of our most common verbs are irregular!

### Auxiliaries
- Minor (or ‚Äúfunction‚Äù) class of words
- Signalers of verbs (‚Äúhelping verbs‚Äù)

#### Task: Add one, two, three, four auxiliaries to this sentence: _He goes._

#### Function of auxiliaries
- Determining tense, aspect, and voice
- Adding information about likelihood, ability, obligation, etc.
- Structuring questions and negatives

### Exercise: Identify Auxiliaries and Main Verbs
1. Mary had been having so much fun.
2. She should have called her mom.
3. She will be grounded.
4. Now, she has to stay home all weekend.
5. Mary is frustrating her parents.
6. Curfews can be frustrating.
    
### Adjectives
- Semantic definition: ‚ÄúDescribing words‚Äù
- Morphological definition:
<details>
  <summary>üëÜ Click me</summary>
Defined by the morphological features applicable to adjectives: have an adjective-making morpheme; takes comparative and superlative morphemes <br>
</details>

- What are some adjective derivational suffixes?
- What are some adjective inflectional suffixes?
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d367fced-07c4-4e7f-a38a-f0a1390385ec)
  
#### Comparative (_-er_ or _more_)
#### Superlative (_-est_ or _most_)
  
### Adverbs
- Semantic definition:
     
<details>
  <summary>üëÜ Click me</summary>
words that usually modify (limit or restrict the meaning of) verbs <br>
</details>
       
- Morphological definition:
<details>
  <summary>üëÜ Click me</summary>
Defined by the morphological features applicable to adverbs: have an adverb-making morpheme; takes comparative and superlative morphemes <br>
</details>
      
They are almost the same as adjectives morphlogically. How do we further tell them apart?  
  
- Syntactic feature:
<details>
  <summary>üëÜ Click me</summary>
Adjectives proceed or follow nouns; adverbs can be (almost) anywhere in the sentence. <br>
</details>
       
#### Different roles for adjectives  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc45e9f1-0428-4ced-952e-7006defb67b5)

- Very frequent adverbs are usually grouped according to the extra information they add to verbs:
  - Time: now, today, nowadays, yesterday
  - Duration: already, always, still, yet
  - Frequency: often, seldom, never, sometimes, always
  - Location: there, here, everywhere, somewhere, elsewhere, upstairs, abroad, outside, nearby
  - Direction: away, thence
  - Concession: still, yet
  - Sequence: afterward, next, then
  
Note: Some words look like adverbs but are not:
  - He ran _towards_ us.

What do you think is the most frequently used word class in English?  


### Objectives for this lesson
- Understand what word class is
- Use morphological and syntactic features to identify the word classes of nouns and pronouns
- Understand the distinction between common and proper nouns, count and non-count nouns, abstract and concrete nouns
- Distinguish sub-classes of pronouns

### Identifying word class
Word class = Part of Speech (POS)
- Traditional means of teaching word class: using semantic features
  - Noun = person, place, or thing
  - Verb = action word
- We will use morphological and syntactic features to identify word classes
  - The builder‚Äôs _plan_ was to lay the foundations in a fortnight.
  - They _plan_ to visit Paris next spring.
 
### ‚ÄúMajor‚Äù and ‚ÄùMinor‚Äù word classes
- Major class words: Content words
  - Noun (_castle_)
  - Verb (_decide_)
  - Adjective (_happy_)
  - Adverb (_beautifully_)

- Minor class words: Function words
  - Pronoun (_their_)
  - Determiner (_the_)
  - Auxiliary (_will_)
  - Preposition (_across_)
  - Conjunction (_and_)
  - Particle (break _up_)

### Nouns: What do we already know?
- A person, place, thing, idea, event, etc.

**But we can	also	identify	content	words	by	 their	forms	(morphology)	and	where	 they	are	in	the	phrase	or	sentence	 structure	(syntax).**
  
### ID tests of ‚Äúnoun-ness‚Äù
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60fcd955-bcd4-481b-a0dd-9b348711ca5c)

Basically...  
- A noun is a word that can be made plural and/or possessive; it is signaled by determiners

### Common/Proper nouns
- Common nouns are general names.
- Proper nouns are specific people, places, or things.
- Proper nouns are capitalized.
  - The **singer** was excited to take the stage.
  - **Taylor Swift** released her new album today.

### Concrete/Abstract nouns
- Concrete: tangible (people, objects, events)
- Abstract: intangible (ideas, values, emotions)

### Collective and non-count nouns
- Collective nouns
  - Can be followed by singular or plural verb form depending on meaning
    - The **team** is here on vacation.
    - The **team** have chosen different restaurants.
- Non-count nouns
  - Do not take a/an
    - The car needed **oil**.
  - Some can be both
    - Example: water, experience

### Pronouns
Pronouns help us avoid repetition!
- Michael bought the cheesecake for Michael, and Michael ate it all.
- Michael bought the cheesecake for himself, and he ate it all.

### What are pronouns
- They stand in for
  - Nouns
  - Noun phrases
  - Nominals
- A pronoun‚Äôs **antecedent** is the name for what the pronoun stands in for.

### Pronoun subclasses
#### Personal pronouns
  - Subject and Object forms
  
#### Possessive pronouns
  - Take the place of a noun and show possession.
    - I want *yours*.
    - They left *theirs* at home.

"My car is expensive." Is "my" a possessive pronoun?  
  
#### Demonstrative Pronouns
- Convey information about the position of something.
  - _this_/_that_/_these_/_those_
    - The girl wants **this**.
    - **That** is unbelievable.
  
"That car is expensive." Is "that" a demonstrative pronoun?

#### Reflexive Pronouns
Formed by added _‚Äìself_ or _‚Äìselves_ to the personal pronouns
- Must have their antecedent in the same clause.

#### Emphatic Reflexive Pronouns
- Also known as intensive pronoun.
- Serve as appositive to emphasize a noun, but movable
  - I *myself* checked the locks before leaving the house.
  - The oncologist *himself* confirmed the patient‚Äôs diagnosis.

#### Reciprocal pronouns
**Each other** and **one another**
- Used as objects to refer to previously named nouns
  - The children borrow from each other.
  - Juan and Claudia help each other. 
  - The sisters never wrote to one another.

#### Indefinite pronouns
There are a lot of them!
- Express quantities, definiteness
- Often unidentifiable antecedent  
  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79dfa079-e657-40cf-911b-80731babf5a0)  
  
#### Interrogative Pronouns
- Used to ask questions
   Includes some Wh- words (_who_/_whose_/_whom_/_which_)

#### Relative Pronouns
_who_, _whom_, _whose_, _which_, _that_
- Occur in relative clauses (clauses that modify their antecedents)

## 9/3 Morphology
### Objectives for this lesson
- Understand that words have an internal structure (studied in the branch of linguistics known as morphology)
- Apply morphological concepts like root and affix in analysis of word structure
- Understand the difference between derivational and inflectional word formation
### Warm-up question
#### What‚Äôs the difference between these?
- word
- morpheme
- syllable

<details>
  <summary>üëÜ Click me for answer</summary>
  word: the	smallest	unit	of	language	that	can	stand	on	its	own   <br>
  morpheme: the smallest meaningful unit in a word   <br>
  syllable: a word or part of a word that contains a single vowel sound   
</details>
  
#### What makes [this poem](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/42916/jabberwocky) English sounding?
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31e66e30-4499-4d8b-af95-fae7c37b29c3)


### Morphological structure in English
We call word parts **morphemes**. Morphemes are the smallest meaningful part of language, but unlike words, they don‚Äôt have to be able to stand on their own.

![364076562-1aa87274-ea3f-4685-b979-bdfe780580c7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5d9f480-7653-43c5-8a70-f08907c9a4c2)

### Bound and Free morphemes
- Many morphemes cannot stand alone as words; they are **bound** to other morphemes.
- **Free** morphemes are able to **stand on their** own as words.
- A free morpheme is a word; a bound morpheme is not.

### Free morphemes
A free morpheme is the smallest meaningful unit in language that can stand alone.  
<pre>
health  
giraffe  
week  
side  
boomerang  
sun  
up  
</pre>

#### Compounds
In English we can combine two free morphemes to create compounds that have a new meaning together.
<pre>
weekend      week + end  
sunlight     sun + light  
playground   play + ground  
upend        up + end  
downside     down + side  
moonlight    moon + light  
</pre>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3ff95b6-2aa7-4c73-bf1b-309369a2afda)  

### Bound morphemes
A compound must have two free morphemes. The following are not compounds because the morphemes are not all free:  
<pre>
nonsense  
unkind   
kindness   
removes  
</pre>  

#### Practice
Think of words with morphemes that fit the following formula: (e.g. free + bound = birds; bound + free = rerun)
1. free + bound
2. bound + free
3. free + bound + bound
4. bound + free + bound
5. free + free
6. bound + free + bound + bound
7. bound + bound
8. bound + bound + bound

### Roots and affixes
- root: the base of a word, the morpheme that gives the word its primary lexical meaning
- affix: a morpheme which can come before (prefix) or after (suffix) a root
  
Example: _unhelpful_  
- _un_: affix	(prefix)
- _help_: root
- _ful_: affix	(suffix)

#### Roots
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/390407e8-0f60-4999-92a2-75e68498cbda)

#### Affixes
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3edfc800-4669-4465-ae13-f5ac3ad11e0f)
  
##### Prefixes vs. Suffixes
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27143718-58d5-4ba0-9266-62daee5d7f04)

#### Practice
- What are the roots of the following words?  
a) domestication  
b) mistrustful  
c) joyfulness  
  
<details>
  <summary>üëÜ Click me for answer</summary>
a) domestic  <br>
b) trust  <br>
c) joy  <br>
</details>

#### Identifying roots
Find the common root for the following sets of words. What does the root mean?  
<pre>
nova             auditor             endure              conceive
renovation       audience            duration            capable
innovate         inaudible           durable             susceptible
novice           auditorium          during              capture
novelist         audio               endurance           intercept
</pre>

<details>
  <summary>üëÜ Click me for answer</summary>
nova: classical Latin nova, feminine singular of novus, meaning new.  <br>
audi: classical Latin audƒ´re, meaning to hear.  <br>
dure: Latin d≈´rus, meaning hard.  <br>
capt: classical Latin capere, meaning to take.
</details>

**Tip:** We as ISU students have access to [Oxford English Dictionary](https://go.openathens.net/redirector/iastate.edu?url=https://www.oed.com), where you can find detailed etymology for words.  
  
### Affix: Derivational vs. Inflectional
What‚Äôs the difference?  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e6914a5-96d4-45e9-91c3-1ef1cab7a598)  
- Derivational morphemes **form new words**.
- Inflectional morphemes do not create new words.

#### Derivational morphemes
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b365293f-c264-44b2-9082-4fdc8ad92805)  
Derivational morphemes **form new words**. They do this by altering either the lexical meaning of a root (e.g., nonsense) or by changing the grammatical category of the word (e.g., kindness).  
##### Some derivational morphemes
1. -able
2. -age
3. -ese
4. -ward(s)
5. -esque
6. -ify
7. -less
8. -ness
9. -wise
##### The problem with derivational morphemes
Derivational morphemes are not systematic; they are arbitrary and there are no rules:

sweet: sweetness  
happy: happiness  
kind: kindness  
**but not**
sunny: sunniness  
difficult: difficultness  
warm: warmness  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2ad7a53-304f-4bbc-8c2c-0cb0efe3fd46)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/117958ff-53a2-45bd-aaaf-7367422e18eb)
  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc98d7ab-e69e-4a72-b168-ce34b5110093)

#### Inflectional morphemes
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/613f4185-efc9-412d-ba23-d58a4145b3dc)
- Inflectional suffixes change words but do not make new words.
- All inflectional morphemes are suffixes.
- There are now only eight inflectional morphemes.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/769c8e24-0c23-4a74-94fb-418defac6182)
  
##### Practice
Identify the inflections in the bolded words.
- Example: He **wishes** he could come.
  - -es is the 3rd person singular _s_
 
The August 2020 derecho windstorm was **bigger** than most people remember. The straight-line wind
**gusts** **measured** up to 110 mph in Iowa. Trees were **broken** off by the wind. Nevertheless, **ISU's**
campus **remains** the **prettiest** campus in the world.

## 8/29 Study of Grammar
### Objectives for this lesson
- Identify how grammar is defined
- Learn key influences on English usage (e.g., prescriptive vs. descriptive grammar, regional and social dialects, language standards)
  
### Before we dive in, some questions to think about...
1. Before this course, how would you define what "grammar" is?
2. Do you know someone who is a strict "grammar police"? Do you agree with them? Why?
3. Can you think of any expressions you use now that a different generation might not understand?
4. Can you think of any expressions that someone from a different geographic area uses but you find awkward?
5. Share a time when you criticized or were criticized because of your language use. What was it that made the language nonstandard ‚Äî was it an error or a dialect difference? Do you feel the correction was appropriate?
6. How should language teachers handle dialect differences in the classroom?  

Pick a few questions to discussion with people around you!  

### In-class readings
- Read ["What is grammar and how is grammar used?"](https://canvas.iastate.edu/courses/113318/modules/items/6622711) (5 min)
- Read ["Varieties of English"](https://canvas.iastate.edu/courses/113318/modules/items/6622759) (5 min)

### Definitions of grammar
- Klammer et al. (2010):
  - ‚Äúthe linguistic system that presumably exists in the mind of a speaker of a language‚Äù
    - Syntax + morphology
  - ‚Äúthe knowledge to which we refer when we say that someone "knows" a language.‚Äù
  - ‚Äúa description of the language system‚Äù
  - ‚Äúan ideal set of rules‚Äù
    - *He always uses good grammar.*
  - a handbook containing the prescriptive rules
    - *Look it up in your grammar.*

### Prescriptive and Descriptive Grammar
- Descriptive rules: ‚Äúhow our grammatical system operates, rules that are the same for all speakers of English (e.g., subjects precede verbs in most sentences).‚Äù
- Prescriptive rules ‚Äúgovern the version of English considered appropriate (e.g., Standard American English)‚Äù

### Evolution of grammar study
- The reason why grammar gets a bad rap
- Two hallmarks:
  - Insisted only certain ‚Äúhigh‚Äù forms of English were worth studying
  - Studied it in an complicated, obscure way, using a system borrowed from Latin

### Prescriptive grammar
- The view that one variety (or use) of a language has an inherently higher value than others and ought to be the norm for the whole of the speech community (Crystal, 1995)  
- An approach to the study of grammar that stipulates the grammatical forms that speakers should use or ought to use. (Cummings, 2018)

### Modern/Descriptive views of grammar
- Objective
- More data-driven
- Studying language as it's actually used	by members of a	speech community in	real world contexts

### Prescriptive vs. Descriptive grammar
What camp do you consider yourself to be in at this point? Why?

### ‚ÄúStandard‚Äù and ‚ÄúNonstandard‚Äù
What is your grammar ‚Äútolerance‚Äù? What about the following sentences that make them incorrect from a prescriptive standpoint? 
1. Edwin keeps insisting that the black hole theory has never been proven.
2. Gavin will graduate from bartending school next week.
3. Your brother does not seem nearly as eager to find a job as I.
4. Joey has finally received the body-building course he sent for.
5. Ellen complained that there is too little variation in the cafeteria menus from week to week.
6. I am going to need a long rest when this semester ends.

### Let's revisit these questions:
1. Before this course, how would you define what "grammar" is?
2. Do you know someone who is a strict "grammar police"? Do you agree with them? Why?
3. Can you think of any expressions you use now that a different generation might not understand?
4. Can you think of any expressions that someone from a different geographic area uses but you find awkward?
5. Share a time when you criticized or were criticized because of your language use. What was it that made the language nonstandard ‚Äî was it an error or a dialect difference? Do you feel the correction was appropriate?
6. How should language teachers handle dialect differences in the classroom?  

### Why do we use language differently?
- Language change
- Dialects
- Language development

### Summary of this lesson
- Key definitions in the study of grammar, such as prescriptive/descriptive approaches, dialects, standard and nonstandard language
- Reasons for variations in grammar
