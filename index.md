# English 2200

## 8/29
### Objectives for this lesson
- Identify how grammar is defined
- Learn key influences on English usage (e.g., prescriptive vs descriptive grammar, regional and social dialects, language standards)
  
### Before we dive in, some questions to think about...
1. Before this course, how would you define what “grammar” is?
2. Do you know someone who is a strict prescriptivist? Do you find yourself more in the “prescriptive” or “descriptive” camp? Why?
3. Can you think of any words you use now that which different generation would recognize but of which they might not understand your meaning?
4. Can you think of any words that someone of a different generation would not recognize or understand?
5. Can you think of any words that someone from a different geographic area would not understand?
6. Share a time when you criticized or were criticized because of your language use. What was it that made the language nonstandard—was it an error or a dialect difference? Do you feel the correction was appropriate?
7. How should language teachers handle dialect differences in the classroom?
